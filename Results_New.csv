or do this do you  still feel that 3D judgment to here be  being a man in the beauty industry yeah  hair judgment I think they are still  like getting comfortable yeah yeah as  like I'm growing and people are like  recognizing and appreciating my work but  but  it's maybe it's getting easier because  people are recognizing your words yeah  because they still find it hard to  accept that they can't go out and tell  people okay like my son is like a beauty  content creator oh you're a very much  boy boy looking  um  like there are a lot of boys who also  complain they reject us  [Music]  foreign  foreign  Ty is a lot of times  means your father it's more about  male pleasure as per the patriarchal  society we are living in but that is not  right  hello everyone this is ankush bahugna I  am back with yet another episode of the  gentleman show by the man company  life says  the topic is skin care and um  because then you'll find out why I'm  saying that is  and um this one's gonna be fun it feeds  um so we have today with us a  dermatologist Dr gunjan hi Hi how are  you feeling I'm good thank you are you  still nervous okay this is the first  time that I'm on a podcast but there's  always the first time so I mean don't  worry  so if that makes you feel better  yashwant yashwant Hi how are you hi I'm  good and uh I haven't introduced you for  a reason so the thing is that Dr gunjan  is very new to Instagram  and yeah I just try new products I share  my experience yeah  um are you are you well versed with this  whole world of influencers and content  creators uh not much but yes because  patients come to us and you know they  let us know okay we've been using this  because we were you know advised by  certain you know people on the net or  whatever you do so we are getting to you  know know this kind of a word exists is  that is that is that the reason why  you've just come on Instagram yeah so  it's that's yes the reason because uh  we're forced to come on to Instagram  because of the patience we have to know  what the patients are getting there  right information from and what  information are they getting yeah so  it's important to be out there and put  out the right thing right because  there's so many of them nowadays you  know creating content that you need to  know what exactly is about there for the  patients to you know  dermatologist  people need to know like they should get  the information from the but experts  only but yes  the community that you guys have all  built all the uh can't how do you like  to address yourself  are you are you a beauty Creator are you  uh are you an influencer are you a  content creator or are you just saying  influencer Beauty Creator you're a  beauty Creator yeah because like like  I'll talk about from scan care to makeup  products to Hair Care everything okay so  Beauty Creator yeah take care okay so  it's not just skin care but Beauty on  the whole yeah  like I think that's a huge compliment  key you know uh this is this onset of uh  content creators in the beauty industry  has led to dermatologists  it's because there is so much  misinformation  a lot of content creators don't even  realize what they are talking about and  it is very much needed that uh the maths  and estheticians they share their  experience and everything so people  choose the best and they monitor yeah  exactly there is yeah very very  important there might be some overlap  but then the domain is slightly  different so that dermatologist won't be  trying out different brands and talking  about it right you know we are not into  trying out different cosmetic brands we  are more into what uh technical or  medical information is being put out  there yes  what you do because as a content creator  as a beauty Creator like you like to  call yourself  tell us more about it I think that goes  for every creator  like it doesn't like it's not limited to  Beauty creators yes I'm I'm talking to  you as a Creator only I just want you to  share your experience about  how difficult it is to sometimes explain  to people  it is very difficult because they just  feel like you are just applying products  and you're just talking about products  what is it like like how's it working  like how are you making money all of  that so  when uh when Beauty creators say uh okay  I've been trying out these products for  like a week or a month does it actually  happen  I can talk about myself I can't I yeah I  can't avoid others I uh like I always  make clear like whenever a branch reach  out to me I always tell them that I need  a like a four week time or something  before I even talk about the product  yeah I mean even I recently uh did this  brand collab I'm not gonna name the  brand I did this brand collaboration  where  um I was like if it's a skin care  product it's not a makeup product that  you can just apply and find out if it  works yeah skincare products take time  for you too obviously like other visible  difference at least you know that it's  not getting worse or at least it feels  healthier whatever like there are some  products like a cleanser or maybe a  sunscreen which you can use a couple of  times and figure out like whether it's  working like a week maybe you can see  like if it's not like ruining your skin  I think the concept skincare products  usually as a Creator you've tried so  many products  mostly the exfoliants and serums like  the treatments basically right so yeah  if you are using a vitamin C or say  retinoid stuff you need four five six  weeks to even see  like some changes so uh Dr gunjan is uh  looking at both us creators talking  about skin care and you know exports is  like uh I have formal education in this  hello but uh Dr kunjun what is your  honest opinion on like after  we've already established  influences  you know what I mean so as someone who's  qualified in this field what is your  honest opinion on influences then you  have to be absolutely honest  um Frankly Speaking I mean I don't I'm  not very familiar with the work of the  influencers because uh I've not been  going on to the social media myself to  check out uh you know  it's just when the patients come to us  they're already using certain products  and we assume that they've got the  information from the net and uh you know  from such sources so it's not as if  we've checked out the videos exactly  what has been put out we are getting  into that but and a lot of  dermatologists are creating content  themselves but right huh actually  there's like a big overlap now that's  what dermatical specials is a very open  to like vitamin C or retinoids because  the pharmaceutical companies have their  products the cosmetic companies are  their products so there is a clash you  know so we are basically more concerned  about the exact content or the  formulation then which brand you are  using is up to you right right and yes  uh have you ever thought about this I am  a content creator but you know like a  lot of creators have now started saying  like you just mentioned if you have a  skin allergy or if you have like a skin  condition then influences are not the  people that you need to look up to  because you need to consult a  dermatologist yeah so how do you  differentiate  and when do you need to go to a  dermatologist I mean I get DMS from  people they send me pictures like with  their face acne rashes and stuff and I  just tell them you have to see a dermat  go see a doctor I'm not the one because  I don't have like a medical degree so I  can only talk about the products and  share my experience I can't give you  medical advice  you know you have um  you know because skincare it's a little  unpredictable sometimes yeah it is it's  very personal that's what it's very  first you nobody can really predictions  foreign no I don't recommend I just  share my experience it's up to the  person I just talk about like the  results I have seen so as as a content  creator do you also how do you keep  yourself up to date with all the  knowledge products  um  hyaluronic acid became very popular yeah  uh like I think materials use the latest  like some peptides and you know like all  these Pokemon sounding names  but I also keep reading up because there  are so many new actives and chemicals  for that matter even we have to read it  up because this is not something we were  taught in the medical school person  right huh right so even we have to  update ourselves once in a while because  there's so many things out there that  you know and there's so many you know  new things coming up every now and then  that you have to update yourself but as  a dermatologist are you also personally  into skincare  yes to some extent I would say  of course I mean like um I first I mean  um I'm on the wrong side of 40. so I've  taken the car up till now I've taken a  concert I've not gone into invasive skin  care you know I've stayed away from  Botox that's a personal choice right A  lot of people even in their 30s and  totally acceptable nowadays want to go  in for such treatments I have not so  even being a dermatologist and uh you  know when I have access to all these  things I've stayed away from it but  that's a personal choice  I'm sure a lot of my listeners right now  will be wondering here Botox  so Botox is more of something which you  inject into your skin to relax the  muscles so like you have deep creases or  whatever exactly so you have crow's feet  or you know a deep forehead  so deep lines go relax the muscle is  relaxed when you inject it into it and  gently last for for three to six months  effects once you're into it you have to  continue it because the effect will last  only for three to six months  exactly the second is fillers um so  Botox is more for the upper face where  you have those creases and all that  fillers is something which you inject  into it so to  um you know if there's a loss of fat  pads you know there's sunken eyes or  sunken cheeks or to Contour your face or  jawline  though personally I'm not doing these  procedures but that is what is done yeah  so inject things into yours you know  skin which you know kind of fills up the  space to replace the fat loss to Contour  your face or jawline or lip contouring  or whatever yes have you ever gotten  confused with these Advanced Skin Care  fillers generally last you forever  like I said I follow a lot of like dorm  ads estheticians and I'll read about  them so yeah so keep yourself updated  basically like we have to give it to  them like so many like uh estheticians  dermats cosmetic formulators like all of  them are their own social media they're  sharing eight minutes  that's tradition and a dermatologist  so uh I would call myself a  dermatologist because my practice mainly  clinical Dermatology the problem areas  but yes you can't keep away from  cosmetic nowadays because you get a lot  of patients who are wanting advice  regarding cosmetics and all that so yes  I'm into cosmetic also but not purely  cosmetic then there are certain  dermatologists who are purely into  cosmetic procedures okay so they're more  into you know medical facials and or  whatever these Dermatology procedures  Beauty procedures kind of thing so their  focus area is cosmetic procedures and  less of problem area of course they can  deal with them and they are aware of the  problem so they are better better at  handling the Cosmetic procedures because  in case there is a problem area they can  deal with that too yeah yeah but the  focus is mainly the Cosmetic procedures  so I want to ask yes like you were just  saying uh you started doing skin care  then you got into Korean skincare and it  made a difference to your skin that's  when you became a Creator so what is  that earliest memory in your life when  you realized key I I like skincare  I think after I got into Korean beauty  uh within a year I started like noticing  some difference like I had like very  severe like acne prone skin oh wow yeah  it's not there anymore like it is like I  do get breakouts but yeah it's much  better than okay yeah how it was so yeah  like once I saw the results I like like  this is like cool I will and I like you  enjoy doing it after a point I think  that's how I see it like after a long  day I have to like engage in my like  nighttime routine you know it's it's so  interesting how different people feel  differently about skin care like a lot  of people love skin care because it  shows a difference to their skin  obviously  why I love skincare is because I don't  know it just feels very therapeutic  it's like tomorrow  put on like a nice moisturizer let your  skin absorb it and whatever and when you  put on a face mask and it's drying it's  the only time I get when I'm not doing  anything I'm not stressing yeah so I've  realized that over time I started  skincare cookies  I just randomly started doing skincare  and then it started showing a difference  to my skin like my skin tones  and ctm actually made a big difference  to my you know the way my skin looked  and then I it became a habit  it makes me feel really calm exactly  like even I started like initially it  was like to treat my acne basically but  after a point like I started enjoying it  so I started buying new products like  whatever was there  it makes you feel good about yourself  yeah yeah exactly so have you ever  yashwant have you ever seen  have you ever seen men in your family do  skin care before you not really it was  my mom I think who like introduction  yeah she was the one she always made  sure that I was using sunscreen so I  used to play tennis basically so she was  like you have to apply sunscreen okay so  yeah sunscreen  so basically my dad's side of family was  like Dusky and my mom is like very fair  so she made sure that like we are  applying sunscreen so we don't get dark  basically yeah um  actually like this obsession with  fairness and skin care as a  dermatologist doctor yes you still get a  lot of you know patients who are you  know and wanting fairness as the end  result kind of thing so you have to  counsel them that you have to be  comfortable in the skin complexion that  God has given you it should be a clean  healthy skin even skin tone that is the  main aim of any cosmetic treatment it is  not fairness  the differences initially it was just  the female patients used to come in for  this thing but nowadays you get a lot of  male patients who are you know conscious  about their complexion  umedding females used to drop in you  know complexion whatever now you get a  lot of male patients who are about to  have you know get um married or whatever  and they're conscious about their  complexion and all that you know I'll  admit there was a phase where I think  also because my sisters went through  that sort of uh conditioning  fairness cream I'm sure everybody in  India has at some point had that phase  so I also had that phase where I would  you know  and then  exactly nobody's ever turned fair by any  fairness  the advertisement the power of  advertisement  s and you know it's so funny that uh men  usually don't talk about skin care they  don't want to associate themselves with  skin care but kittens  this is a legendary they don't want to  accept it that they are using yeah so  yeah so that's what I wanted to talk  about  men don't  men find it cool to say  you know it's become like a flex  key I'm not into all of this  why why is that because basically like  like as we grow like we are conditioned  in a way like as guys we don't have to  like take care of ourselves we have to  be rough and stuff yeah like girls are  supposed to like apply products and look  beautiful guys don't have to like look  after their skin  and have things change now  um I have daughters so I can't really  say about the younger generation but yes  when I see the patients that come in yes  I'm not talking about my personal family  but yes when I see the patients who come  in um you get a lot of you know on  teenage boys who are worried about their  skin or even the younger group who also  I think basic skin care and hygiene is  mandatory so irrespective of the gender  that is mandatory you know so certain  everybody needs to be a little  presentable and well groomed so some  basic things are mandatory Advanced Skin  Care As I said is of course a privilege  you may or may not want to go for it you  might not be using a very complicated  skincare when you are not you know um  it's not necessary that you use a very  complicated skin care regime but certain  Basics and hygiene of course is  mandatory is your family like your  immediate family or your extended family  do they understand  why you do what you do or do this do you  still feel that is being a man in the  beauty industry yeah hair judgment I  think they are still like getting  comfortable yeah yeah as like I'm  growing and people are like recognizing  and appreciating my work but but  it's maybe it's getting easier because  people are recognizing your words yeah  because they still find it hard to  accept that they can't go out and tell  people okay like my son is like a beauty  content creator is  yeah and we all we've all discussed  multiple times the whole conversation  about men in makeup and you know the  whole perception that is there around  yeah so yeah so you still feel that even  even though you get so much love on the  internet for the content that you make  yeah in real life so we we're not there  yet yeah we are not so so then how do  you deal with it  you know you're still doing something  which is  you can say unconventional but the  content creation is fairly new yeah but  I think  as long as I am happy I don't care what  people think beat my family or the other  people so yeah  I think subscribe  exactly so it will make a little  difference but there is no overnight  Solutions  no no there are patches which she's  talking about you like put it on your  acne dehydrates foreign  coming up or something so it's like  emergency remedy kind of a thing one off  thing once in a while it's not a routine  a treatment for acne and there is no  shortcut for acne treatment any patches  or your drying Solutions are gonna be  expensive  drying solution it's like I recommend it  to my friend he's like yeah  exactly I mean you don't have to resort  to these things you need you need to  take care of your acne properly take  proper treatment so that you know you  overcome the bout of acne yeah but these  are like uh short-term you know these  are this is not a long-term solution for  your act yeah as a Creator and I'm  totally um sorry I'm sorry I'm totally  okay if they don't invest into such  overnight remedies and rather invest  into long-term treats very long-term  treatment sorry so it's a routine it's  like my life  especially with someone who's not into  skincare so much but if you are having  problem you know moderate to severe acne  once in a while breakout is fine but  then if you are having acne that really  uh you know makes a person conscious or  aware then they really are you know open  to treatments Ah that's true because  self-confidence  exactly so most of the patients are  desperate to get rid of them anyhow and  then  ready to follow  so  when when men come for these I know that  happening  um  esthetician I know that you're not an  esthetician but I'm sure you know many  yes so when men come for these Botox and  fillers is I think it's getting more  popular amongst men also now absolutely  are they secretive about that  uh because tabuto here like even with  women there's a type of people exactly I  mean I think in general it's not gender  specific in general people don't really  talk about it too much yeah they want to  get it done but they don't want to  what's the point I get it I get it but I  also feel that Botox fillers still  people accept  they associate that with women so when  men come and get it done are they you  know are they uncomfortable with it  themselves I don't think so oh you know  um um most of my colleagues they do  discuss their male patients and you know  even men get you know decreases and on  their foreheads and all that  um so I think they're quite comfortable  but I think for fillers and Botox and  everything like even the girls are not  comfortable sharing it because there is  a lot of shaming shaming exactly that's  what I'm saying people don't you don't  want people to know that you've got it  done so that is not gender specific  that's true for what males and females  and  the men that you think are very manly  according to you and you know so you  shame other people on the internet for  being into makeup skin care all your  favorite Heroes apply makeup all your  favorite Heroes uh get started even for  you know female actresses oh she got  this done I mean everybody is getting in  this what's so different about her you  know and like he said how do you look  that young at that age because I look at  I look at like all these Heroes who are  you know  so like they're they're as old as some  of my relatives but both  normal 50 year old professional demand  to look good on screen or whatever young  50 year old actors  really give that unrealistic image like  you can't like expect that result from  like applying topical products basically  on your skin and because  men are not used to hearing skin care is  actually very common yeah he's got a  point it's because you know people at  times you know what these are the  unrealistic expectations you know when  patients come in for cosmetic procedures  so that is not the point because all  these Heroes and actors and like  whenever they are asked how do you like  you look so young and stuff it would be  like  exactly  so so unrealistic expectations have to  be managed  camera or photoshop it's not Photoshop  videos  foreign  who is the modern gentleman  yashwant  I think who's Liberal Liberal yeah you  have to be Progressive and like  basically open to  like other people like you shouldn't be  like uh you shouldn't have like those  preconceived notion about peoples yeah  judgmentally yeah basically you should  be like just broad-minded and yeah  that's pretty cool  that's nice what about you  difficult to put it out in a word but I  would say confident and comfortable in  this skin I think they're comfortable  talking about their issues so choose  both okay  comfortable  yeah okay great so we got the answers  thank you so much it was great having  both of you and I think it's great that  we had both the perspectives on this  discussion  one-sided conversation so thank you so  much for joining us and um I hope this  was a good experience for you guys yeah  yeah it was thank

 for all the listeners also and you Arun  have you ever you know sat her down  you know how we treat other important  people in our lives like friends key I  think you're good at this you should do  this what are your passions what do you  like doing have you ever had that  conversation with your mother because I  haven't I can't get myself too because  it's just we've never been like that oh  you're a very much boy boy looking  foreign  like there are a lot of boys who also  complain they reject us  [Music]  some friends on us because we are nice  how fragile masculine tea is a lot of  times  means your power  male pleasure as per the patriarchal  society we are living in but that is not  right  hello everyone this is ankush bahugana  and you've tuned in to the gentleman  show by the man company jaha par we will  discuss the modern gentleman or harvo  aspects  there but mostly  okay  about mothers and how easy it is to  share everything with them with a very  special guest Arun who is a comedian who  is a content creator who's an RJ who  does a lot of things and Arun I want to  say  is  Uncle like uncle has become a cool word  so that's pretty cool but thanks for  having me ankush yeah I mean I'm looking  forward to having like a very good  insightful conversation about you know  mothers and sons because I think that  it's a topic  yeah and interesting that you said  and then they worry about birth and all  my mom would say  I'm like why are moms like this  that's so difficulties  like fulfilled me she'll be like uh  foreign  [Laughter]  [Music]  those in Delhi NCR know there is this  play also yeah  and of course  is the perfect fun fact I was once in  the process of auditioning for that show  really but I like I mean the rehearsals  are very hectic so I couldn't make it  this is back when I used to learn like  there was a very little phase in my life  where I was like trying to learn how to  dance professionally okay whatever that  means but yeah I was doing that and then  I was like wow this sounds exciting  anyway we've taken another tangent so  let's come back to discussing mothers  what is so I'll tell you so much  so I grew up with two sisters which even  you have so our family setup is very  similar you know uh parents and then  sisters it's like practically we had  four parents yeah yeah yeah  it's like I've had three mothers yeah  very very very similar to that and then  a father also so yeah four parents but  um  so she would take me and all the cousins  were Elder to me like I couldn't play  with them I was a kid  I would just cling on to her and not let  her go because I just didn't want to be  left in a foreign place without my  mother so that was like that's my oldest  memory uh of me and my mom's  relationship she was the only familiar  person in the room at any given time  like even if my sisters around my father  was around  it was my mother that I would usually  just go to like instinctively she is the  one that I would hold on to on every  given in every given situation say I  mean when I had like that fear yeah but  um  and I thought my parents have left  because we've all like felt turkey  minutes  [Laughter]  yeah but probably we have trust issues  also I mean I mean clearly this this  podcast is unraveling things have you  not ready to accept about ourselves but  uh  what is your relationship been like with  your mother like how did it start where  are you guys right now like you know the  whole process of  uh so it started  relationships  couldn't have guessed I know right so  many of us  so anyway so yeah that's how it started  the jokes about but uh I think as every  kid I was always the most closest to my  mom  and uh because the CU grow they see in  different phases of you they see  different sides of you also I think  of course  but I think as sometimes mothers as  persons are emotionally their emotional  quotient is high but which is the case  in with my mom  so that really helped like she could  really see things that others could not  like she identified that I can do some  creative things which I also didn't know  right like she knew that like she would  send me to every summer camp every class  every hobby class that they've ever  existed so she really like of course  I've done everything during my growing  up days right which helped me identify  like she she knew like what he's going  through what is what is in his mind so  her emotional uh sensibilities are I  think strong also which really helped  and that is I am I've always been close  to her so it's not changed over the  years you I won't say that because it  has jobs  so my mom would always  yeah  update basically she would be like but  just message me and I would do that that  and it became a practice it's a fair ask  yeah it is a fair asked  parents  [Music]  body so uh definitely a practice or  ritual  um  having this and then she would say  whatever that happened my sister joined  me here right very recently she's very  chatty and I'm not a phone person really  so she's very chatty she keeps talking  to my mom and she gives all the updates  every updates  and now I'm like yeah  but it's just that I think  which is not fair  I think okay she knows I'm fine I'm  doing okay  telling things to her yourself because  she knows that you know that she's  getting the information from your sister  yeah so so would you actually so you  know  that everybody messages me saying you  know we love your relationship with your  mother you guys are so cute together  this and that and I keep repeating  myself when I answer those questions I  keep repeating myself that what you see  on social media is two individuals  working together you know like she's an  actor so am I I'm a content creator  she's an actor and that's what we're  doing we're creating content together  but those videos can't be a hundred  percent true reflection of our  relationship because  I mean I'm I've been very open about  this that I don't share the healthiest  relationship with my mother so would you  say that you are you're the kind of  relationship that you share with your  mother do you would you say that it's  healthy  yeah it's definitely healthy it's like  two individuals existing on their own  knowing that they love each other but  they don't really feel obligated at  least  I'll speak for myself there's only one  way to know the other side I guess  like she knows that I really love her  and I know she loves me and that's how  it is yeah yeah but I wish there was  like more communication sometimes I feel  like guilty yeah but  um you know like I feel just a Mothers  and relationships  why is my relationship with my mother so  much different and so much more complex  you know  that's so one tone and unidimensional  that is  but where is the real aspect he you know  sometimes your habits just are so  annoying to each other like you can't  sit in a room without fighting  you know all these qualities of my mom  that I don't like that she's a control  freak and she's restless and she's you  know she's not a problem solver  problem  and  with time I'm realizing I am all of that  myself surprise and I'm like I'm you  know this one time I was just irritated  at my mom  just calm down I can see that you're so  like fidgety why it's irritating me  foreign  and then he would complain also you know  I was exhausted myself and I'm like yeah  but that's your choice why did you do  that at the first place so so she's very  huge productive and a productive and a  woman which I don't like now hustle  hustling beyond your like capacity yeah  and uh  um  it's just like waste of time  so she's she loves music but she can't  sit as her arm say to watch a movie  because she thinks it's not productive  now I can't watch series everybody  around me is watching series is just  netflixing and maybe chilling as well  whereas I  I don't like it because I'm like yeah  and now when I'm friends with people who  are who know how to chill and they're  like yeah and they go like I'm like yeah  because I was working  and Mera weekend  job Monday to Friday Saturday Sunday I  have my schedule yeah  impatience control freak like like you  said that you're a people pleaser but  also control freak I relate to that and  my mom was a bad combination though yeah  my mom is also like that like that  translates into backseat driving that  you're just passive and you're telling  people what to do things but you're also  not doing them yourself after a few  minutes  and then I just guys  do you want more juice do you want more  napkins  [Laughter]  no no but uh yeah so I feel music like  you said  you know my other mothers do so much  more and then they also complain and  that used to irritate me so much it  still does  you know now that I've also realized  that when we say it's your choice it's  not really their choice because you know  a lot of Duties that they do  they there's no other way in in the  whole you know I mean we do live in a  sexist society right so mothers  for example  I was talking about resentment right so  when I was growing up  um I mean this is very personal but  anyway I'm okay talking about it when I  was growing up my mom was my mom is an  actor so she used to go to the hills  garvali movies for like weeks and  sometimes a month  and what what that like I I would go to  school and I say parent teacher meeting  my parents have never gone for a parent  teacher meeting also because I was such  a for two kids  but they never came to my parent teacher  meetings because Dad was busy with work  mom had shoots to do and then I would  see other people's moms and you know you  associate a certain image with Mom  and then you see your own mom who's like  a working and she's an independent woman  right she's working she's but then I  would feel like you know  there's something that my mom is not  doing she's not she's absent and you  know she's not around and then I just  looked at her like that that she's so  imperfect as a mother that you know  she's away  and then I realized that this was a  woman who was taking care of her own  Ambitions she comes from a village in  uttarakhand  she comes to the city  she finds her own way in uttarakhand  cinema and she becomes one of the  biggest names there of her time  she's doing that while having three kids  sending them to school and it's also not  keyboard  she would arrange everything and then I  remember she would come back after weeks  of travel come back put the put the bag  right next to the main door head to the  kitchen to cook something for all of us  now that I grew up I feel that we were  so cruel about all of that because  and entitled and entitled and like  complaining about  them you know like I mean she's also a  person right which is what brings me to  my next point that I feel that  we always see this as a mother is doing  it not a person is doing it like mother  is a role that you play it's not your  entire existence it's not your  personality she's she's a human being  right she has her own aspirations and  like when our parents were our age  what about our parents like  Yeah  and I don't think we ever think that we  have we don't look at our mothers like  people  and I think it boy it  just  speciesism of course patriarchy or plus  Generations  nobody knows right what is happening  behind closed doors nobody knows but uh  it's it's unfair and it's it's so my mom  runs a boutique okay and she she really  does it out of passion and she's always  done it also she again struggled it  because so my uh Dadu wasn't really cool  with she pursuing you know this back in  those days when she had just got married  so because we had factories and all and  he's like I'm not really cool with my  daughter-in-law like you know running  her own Boutique and everything  and then like she but he was still  enough like nice enough and she  continued and everything now and now  she's old but she still continues her  work  um  she would leave her work and she would  get up I feel so sad and that you know  visual for me is not that much of guilty  over there but then I was like dude  it's really like worship for me because  also I'm not very social or I don't have  any other uh let's say Hobbies  immediately Recreation is creating  videos Recreation is researching about  something merely Recreation is producing  a nice news piece  [Music]  and I know how passionate she is and how  happy she feels when she does it the way  she gets up it's so endearing and we  will run she loves her job and she loves  the appreciations she gets out of it  she would leave and get up same lovely  my mom will be tired from shoots but  Habibi she'll come back from a shooter  videos  thank you  but that's something that's being used  by everyone what about her gift you know  like why is that gift not for her the  person that she is so I mean to the  listeners listening to this like I mean  this is something that we all need to  think about that this is not something  you glorify  options  for so many women is such a you know  rare think either even in a position  where they can have a career so that's  why they hustle so much  so anything that you do in life do you  think of its repercussions on you know  what your mother would think yeah  a lot of times  and uh there are moments and I'm like  decision she might not be happy with  this and I would do it but I think  again that that comes from the space  where I'm too dependent also on her so  does it should a decision be if it's  about like choosing a table and I will  my mom like it and I'll click a picture  and send it to her and she said and even  if I want it for example if I really  like this brown table I want it and she  says  you won't buy it I would feel so  irritated but I would still not buy it  and I would crave about it that you  didn't let me have this but  I said to go with her choice that's  exactly the same what my mom does with  me like she'll be like um  and then she'll return it and she'll get  something else  and then the the second suit I like what  she won't like but she'll still keep it  and crib here  there's another thing that she does  she would say  um  which is even more hurtful and I'm like  okay now she's told me yeah  and I'm like now what do I do but do you  uh do you like it when your mother  chooses things for you yeah yeah  eventually turns out to be right  um  if she said something so I'm like  look on you or does she like short hair  like appearance wise what does she like  on you  she really likes uh like a neat look and  you don't like that I'm okay I don't  foreign  [Music]  foreign  interesting interesting but uh I don't  know do you ever do you think honestly  do you think  of your mother like a person do you know  her Hobbies do you think you know her  well because I mean let's face it  relationship is a two-way thing right  but somehow our mothers always know us  inside out yeah keep what we like what  our hobbies are what is  through their lives that they just know  it without having that conversation  but do we know them as well do you know  your mother as well  if I say yes that would be my claim  there's nothing to know yeah but do you  feel that you've ever sat her down and  asked her about life  do you know what your mother does when  she's alone at home and nobody's around  yeah she does have batik thing which she  really enjoys and likes and it's  therapeutic for her but when she's not  working let's say she's not doing her  what is she doing when she's alone do  you do you know that  not really  exactly hmm  we don't think these things true but  they'll know if I ask this question to  your mother she will know what you do  when you're not doing anything  um  but yeah she would know but I mean does  there ever come a time where we give it  back to our mothers and like help them  as people who really understand them and  make them realize what their passions  are what their Ambitions are what they  want to do in life because it's never  really that late no yeah does there ever  come that time  for for us to enable and Empower our  mothers  there should be I believe there should  be yeah there really should be  yeah that's when we sort our life  probably and then move on  exactly  priorities basically it's right it's for  those priorities are flawed yeah I feel  that you know every time you talk about  mothers  I feel that the reality is that  being a mother is a very ungrateful role  yeah and we're all to blame just because  it doesn't free us of that you know we  are also part of that system  most of us we don't know  her life doesn't elevate  just because of that one Mother's Day  wish which makes us come to the next  section which is called  so I want you to call your mother  okay and just just talk to her about  something just just ask her what her  passion is what she likes doing  my phone uh phone is on flight mode  first let me turn that off  okay logistical issues  no but I just want you to talk to her  like she's a person and not a mother  cool  oh this is making me feel so awkward and  weird she's like talking to my mom such  an organic thing is  I hope she picks  oh wow  thank you  she doesn't go through  you know what I'll have to do I'll have  to call Dad and this is hello  good afternoon  [Music]  Papa  numbers okay  good afternoon  podcasts  on the radio program types  oversega  hanji  um  personal  he means  um  and that brings us to the end of the  podcast around almost the end of the  podcast  I'm gonna ask you what your final word  is on this Define the word gentleman in  one word  sensible  and when I say sensible it means like  sensible to have sensibilities about the  environment of course all of us are work  in progress  but to be sensitive towards things that  are around you just makes you a better  person every day  but if you're just sensible you learn  you'll pick that sense and that's how  you'll grow yeah yeah I think I I like  the

The Man Company,Friendship is the ultimate adventure! | What's Hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ZNvJsaWrU,"the next question is

oh sorry I don't know what I'm ready for

but I'm ready

well I can go on and on about famous

dialogues from Bollywood on friendship

but today I am here on the streets of

korega Park to find some answers as to

what friendship means to people so let's

go ahead and have this fun Gap shop with

puderi public in association with the

man company

[Music]

ah it's a comfort I guess

that's it that's a comfort zone

wow that's uh

right I think friendship is an

experience

it's it's uh it's different for

everybody

and that's one sentence

the loyalty

honesty

yeah uh someone who could be there for

you all the time uh keeping through

thick and thin I guess not just having a

friend not having friends who are there

for you when things are going well

having friends who are there for you and

times are tough a relation where you

don't have to think and you can just

unload yourself I think yeah

I think that that's what friendship is

if you can do that to someone with

someone and I think that's it uh sending

memes

[Music]

today are all about that right I mean we

all have those friends who we never talk

to but like we only just means yeah I'm

sure a lot of you can relate to it

yes absolutely I think friendship should

be thought of as genderless

if someone is your friend then they are

your friend age and gender and

everything else doesn't matter

[Music]

what a wonderful thought I love it yeah

after a certain period has passed

between that friendship

after a year if girl is giving nobody

then yeah friends otherwise

I don't think so I don't have that much

comfort the friend in like a male friend

so I don't think so

dual power absolutely I think they can I

think it's I have a couple of friends

and I've just been friends with them so

I think it it depends you know if both

is the intent is clear I think it is

possible yeah

[Music]

friends friends obviously friends

friends and friends I think that's

everybody is driving just like that's

the only answer we're getting guys we

need more variety Hello friends

um yeah okay How I Met Your Mother what

about how I met your mother is it is it

yeah okay I'd say How I Met Your Mother

and How I Met Your Mother Big Bang

Theory Big Bang Theory yeah

like we know Brooklyn nine nine so

there's this really famous and popular

kdrama called uh reply 1988 pictures and

uh mirzapur

it was about friendship

that

[Music]

um I never say anything wrong behind

your back behind their back even if

things are not fine between y'all

because at the end of the day they are

always there for you uh choices it has

taught me that I can choose who I want

to spend time with and

um it's taught me to Value people in

relationships patience that you can fall

back to those people when you need them

I think yeah that's what has taught me

and and you can be the one to other your

friends also I think both ways yeah yeah

yeah yeah you can have someone to look

up to and when you're a need for

anything yeah yeah except other people's

flaws I'd say because after being

friends with someone for so long there's

a point of time you very tend to drift

apart from your friends especially your

childhood friend so it's about accepting

other people's flaws and understanding

that you're the truest of your friends

are the people that accept you off relax

my friends I was in an all-gai school

and I'm shy when it comes to women in

any case

I have no guy friends

yeah and why is that uh

uh I don't know just always been that

way I'm a biker so I think my majority

of my community are guys so that's why

girlfriends absolutely

guy friends of you girls um yeah

yeah I have balanced

[Music]

I'd like to think I'm the 2AM friend but

I do have my do not disturb moments

I think we need to talk to your friends

about this question yes I am definitely

the 2AM friend yeah yeah do your friends

think so too absolutely absolutely and I

am the guy that people call for like

The Man Company,Is your DAD the ultimate superhero in your life? | What's Hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802qbrHjLag,foreign  [Music]  one thing's for sure our relationships  with our dads can be a bit awkward so  today let's talk to some people about  their relationships with their fathers  and why it's so challenging to express  our love to them  [Music]  so here we have a gentleman and a lady  and we'll be asking some interesting  questions from them describe your father  in just one word friend maybe yeah  friend respectful hard-working expert  someone I will get all my knowledge from  I would describe it as loving so do you  think we hold our dads to an  unreasonably high standards I think most  people do but I don't 100 I think it's a  very reasonable standard for me my  father is my motivation I don't feel  like you don't feel like that yes we do  and we have a habit of comparing them to  somebody you know bigger in stature and  then we compare everybody else to our  dads so yeah we do that all the time I  think that a high standard is more  applicable especially when you're young  but then as you grow up you realize okay  we were putting so many expectations out  of at the end of the day he's also human  right to do that so my next question is  I think I am kind of an introvert person  right now it's an interview so I'm just  giving answers so my dad is also of the  same nature anger anger yeah same I  guess you both both of them are angry  yeah  resilience strength patience being calm  at the most  chaotic situation I've got this dimple  my walking style tell me who do you call  more frequently your dad or your mom  call or text my dad and what about you  Mom Mom  yeah Mom of course I call my dad  I text him also Mom Mom I think most of  us do so what was the last text that you  texted your father like what was the  last message  my girlfriend's picture oh and what  about you mother  again  why do you think that we can easily  communicate with our moms but when it  comes to our dad it is not usually the  same I think moms have a little soft  corner for their children so that is the  reason otherwise fathers are little  harder to make them understand so that's  why we prefer to speak with a mom  instead of a father like for me it's  kind of a reverse thing I think as we  are all growing women's we think that  our mom would connect with us more as  they would understand us we women  understand each other better than a  father would I think it's easier to show  towards both of them when I feel like  but yeah I'm open to birth and I love  them I'm more friendlier with my Dad I'm  more close to my dad and I have no issue  sharing any kind of topic that a girl  would share with her mom that I would  share with my dad so have you ever said  I love you to your dad and if yes then  what when was it like the last time that  you said I love you that yesterday also  that was a long long time ago years ago  not frequently maybe once in a blue moon  make it in a year but otherwise daily in  my remembrance for sure I did that today  morning can we have that right now too  love you Papa hello Papa ah I love you  probably a month ago I say it every day  I said it just before I left my house  today morning when he dropped me off to  the mall  so sweet and what was his reaction like  he just hugged me yeah  yes never yes I have and you know as a  matter of fact the first time that I  really saw him crying crying emotional  was when I got married I think maybe  when his mom passed away yeah many times  yes I have and it's mostly when I get  hurt he also gets hurt seeing me hurt  one of the moments that you can recall  when I performed this kathak performance  and he was really proud and he was  standing and clapping and he was really  happy and emotional about it do you  think we can do anything to improve our  communication with our dad spend more  time with her dad  I think it is both ways both the party  should be willing to you know put in an  effort in making their relationship  better I think we spend more time  talking to moms giving them more time  and you know spending more time with  them I think time is the key you spend  more time you get to know them more  that's an indirect way of knowing and  you know getting closer to one another I  think time for me is the case  [Music]  every day when I wake up I see him first  then I go and do anything else so that's  the first thing I hug him and every day  at night when I say good night I hug him  oh yes all the time I love hugging him  you know we'll be lucky to see that  happening right now live on the camera  yes of course  that's now the last question there you  go describe the modern gentle man in one  word  one who believe that for the future for  their children so it's a blend of  everything if you ask me what I feel is  a difference since I'm a mom and my  husband of course is a father so what I  feel is different from in a modern day  man from a dad who was like you know  some 20 years ago is the involvement  with the kids we just go with the flu  and treat everyone nicely impatient  and you generous my dad obviously now  that's a super ban so for sure I hope  your dad gets to watch this for sure so  here is something very special for you  for answering everything so candidly and  wisely this is the man companies hamper  for you so lovely perfume from the man  company for your dad we have a special  gift for you from the man company  guys so that you have this amazing time  to the dad and you know just be with  them in the same Aura and the same  fragrance  so we have a very small goodie for you  from the man company this is for you and  of course do give it to your dad thank  you so much thank you for your time  thank you all right ladies thank you so  much for being a part of this fun video  this was an association with the man  company thank you well that's a wrap on  this very special edition of dub shop

The Man Company,The Gentleman Show | EP 04 | What's Your Gender | Nitasha Biswas | @arnabpapu ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVS9uuMk-m4,A wide spectrum  of gender and identities and sexuality  and whatnot so lgbtqia plus stands for  lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer  intersex and ally and there's a plus  because  i think the plus is there because um  you know  till date we have come so far with so  many genders at the moment and the  different um  virtues of being born in this world  right so i think it's going to be more  than plus so i think what's your  pleasure would  it's more about you know you we want to  cover everyone because there might be  people who do not identify as  one of them  and any of these their existence is  still valid of course so that's the  reason and we are unaware about it so  that's the reason we you know want to  cover everyone and be more inclusive and  that's the plus  basic questions  because i feel that  we get  like they've heard transgender but they  don't know what cisgender is yeah so up  uh can one of you or both of you define  for me  cisgender transgender  what is intersex what is cross-dressing  let's just you know clear them first  before answering this question it's very  important to know that what is sex at  birth  what is gender and what is sexual  orientation so let's start with that sex  or gender make africa sex i mean sex is  good and gender  wow okay  gender is uh you know i am born uh i'm  assigned male at birth but then i don't  think from my heart and mind that i'm a  i'm a guy okay so then i am identify i  identify myself as a as a as something  different than my assigned than my uh  sex at birth  someone is born male assigned male 1  i'll tell you my example i'm i'm born  with sex at my sex at birth is male so  is mine yeah yeah i i identify from my  mind and heart as a male so i'm a  cisgendered man  okay so i am also cisgendered man so if  you if you were born to all my listeners  i'm just explaining if you are  assigned  male at birth and you also identify as a  man then you're cisgender yours is  gendered and now sexual orientation is a  very different thing now as a man i am  attracted towards another man  then it's i'm gay and that's got nothing  to do with your gender that's not got  nothing to do with these other two you  know uh fields which i have explained so  but you know i would not say that i'm  100 correct because it's a very very  difficult and complicated topic so i  think there are always difference in  opinions and we are we should be able to  accept those opinions i'm saying that  gay people  can also be cisgender  yep i'm a cisgendered gay man right and  understood okay and natasha tell us  about  the difference between like  transgenders and cisgenders  so like what happened was um when i was  born so i was assigned male and birth  but um as with time i grew i decided  that um i was i was not in the right  body so i want to change i want to  change my um  you know what i was assigned at birth i  wanted to be a female i want to be a  woman so i underwent transition and i  underwent my surgeries and everything to  be called as a woman at this point of  time so what happens over here is that  um  i've transitioned to be a woman and when  i talk about the cisgender women is  someone who is assigned female at birth  or women at birth so that is exactly the  difference over here  so in in simpler terms like uh  transgender people are people who are  assigned one thing at birth right but  they identify something  gender right the one they have so then  do they have to undergo surgery to be  trans  not necessarily i think it's a very  great question because um you know bob  to my belief that i wanted it so it's my  free will to do it so someone there like  there might be a lot of other twins  women who do not want to do it so it's i  think it's a free will also  accessibility  definitely  so you know let me put it like this when  i started my transition  that was back in 2015 long time ago so  what happens over there is there was a  phase in my life where i went to my  psychologist i went to my psychiatrist  because it was necessary to have these  two people the signing before my  surgeries happen because they undergo  rigorous um evaluation to understand  what they are they really wanting to  be of the opposite gender right so  whatever what happens over here is um i  had to cross this for a while to  understand how it feels to wear a bra  how it feels to wear a panty i'm just  going a little bit more inner so people  understand how does it feel when i wear  a dress so over here  i feel good so that is exactly i was  given that green signal that yes you can  go ahead and have your surgery right so  when it comes to cross-dresser a person  doesn't necessarily have to  have i mean have a surgery undergone  why because you know the person is happy  as what the expression they are showing  so again over here then comes the  non-binary  there's a lot of it's like a chain  enough like incan link we've talked  about men we've talked about women we've  talked about trans people there is like  there are non-binary people there are  gender fluid people also right joe who  don't so can you explain what gender  fluid people and non-binary  so people believe see  we have always lived in a world where  everything is defined by binary a male  and a female and one yeah so those are  the two digits right so it is high time  we understand that there can be  different uh you know kinds of people  within that spectrum of zero and one  some defined some undefined some yet to  be defined  and that's where non-binary comes  non-binary means it's a non-zero or a  non-one it can be 0.1 it can be 0.4 so  how much you know towards male or  towards female you know those two  binaries i feel like so they don't  necessarily identify as either basis  either way then also i know one  particular one but suppose i'm dressed i  feel like a man today it might happen  that tomorrow i feel like a woman so i  don't define it you know uh regularly  but then that's how i feel i can't help  it so those are non-binaries okay and  it's  it is none of your business what another  person identifies  one point i always make angus is that uh  whenever you are you know trying to  break out of the rule you become an  exception and an exception always stands  out  so no one wants to be an exception in a  given point of time if someone is trying  hard to become an exception out of uh  the in spite of facing all the ridicule  and you know the hap you know all the  fun being made at that means just  imagine how strongly that person  believes that this is what i want  exactly  i think that's where you know i can i  should put a word here because um  how badly i needed that right and how  badly i needed that body because  the feeling is euphoria when you have  undergone your  journey i would say and  i mean i would love to share it here  when i saw my body first time in the  mirror  without i think skin is the best  clothing on on our body so  it feels euphoria  and that is exactly he just put it in  his voice  but okay so natasha i want to talk to  you about this whole journey and if you  don't mind sharing with us because i  feel that  it may inspire people listening to this  it may also  make more people understand what it is  really like to be trans and growing up  trans right right because i'm pretty  sure that  things were difficult before you  realized you know what being trans is so  can we start from the beginning can you  tell us about your story so like um like  i come from calcutta i was in a all boys  school in san serious calcutta so  of course bullying has been a part of my  life  since um i was little feminine when i  was a boy when i was a young boy so  it's like  you know like those visions coming right  now so it's like um you know fighting  yourself every day when you go to school  and you get to meet your class friends  and  i remember staying alone from the rest  of the boys because i would just not go  out and play football cricket on all the  physical activities that guys would tend  to do during that time remember i'm  talking about 2015 now long time back so  then what happens over here is um  so like growing in that atmosphere  being called names and you know certain  way to behave then you go back home then  i think my only friends were my servants  in the house when i was young right so  since my father's father was an ice  officer i was staying in a huge house  and everything so i couldn't gel  with my other neighbors but the boys  were there so  it was tough but did you always know  that you're trans or it took a while a  woman i would say i always knew i was a  woman okay so deep down within me so i  think that is exactly i  knew from then  at what age what age was this i um  i remember going through a lot of  journeys that time when the first  internet dropped in into calcutta so my  father got the internet so we had  computer classes  and my elder brother who was in the same  school so he told him that you know i  think this is what i represent i feel  like i remember my brother giving me a  porn cd in class sevens class ten or  nine i might be wrong he said you should  see the chemistry between a male and a  female  that time and i was like okay i'm the  female right he literally switched it on  and said i'm going to go to the other  room and see what happens so maybe this  is a phase he told me it's a phase in  your life that eventually will like the  women body i said no i don't want to  you're just forcing me to  do something that i don't want to right  and that's wrong and at that time to  reach i knew that so i think it was in  class seven when i started this  but did you know when people react like  that did it make you question yourself  did it make you  feel like  there's something not uh you know you're  different from other people well  definitely you know imagine um when a  child goes to school  and uh you've been boycotted not been  spoken to because of your behavior  called names like [ __ ] and everything  i think that breaks the spirit of the  child it breaks because a child doesn't  know until you tell them so it made me  believe that i'm different which i was  not  you know so it made me believe that okay  i'm different because this is how the  world thinks about me so yeah that i  think it was tough  i would definitely say it was tough  enough is in  very deep thought right now do you  yeah are you thinking about your  experiences yeah because she's talking  about 2015 i came way back because i'm  much older to other people so over here  so  when i came out i mean i would if i talk  about my journey i think uh  my father expired when i was a little  kid and i was born and brought up you  know i was brought up by my sister and  my mother it was always the female  members who was surrounding me  so  many times uh it has been told that you  are gay because you were always  surrounded by women and as you mentioned  i've also heard  you know if you have a lot of female  energy around you so you know so it it  makes me  question their education because if a  girl is being surrounded by a lot of men  would he become a boy so that's my i  mean you know you know what i mean i  mean so you can't become yeah you can't  become this is not something which i  have chosen this is what i am  so and uh as she mentioned that i was  also not much interested in sports while  my cousins and all my friends were busy  you know playing table tennis and  football and cricket i was i was very  happy and comfortable with playing with  dolls but then  the rules were my i come from a very  orthodox bengali family so they're like  oh why is he not playing qriket he  should be you know he should be  going there learn character and all that  but slowly and steadily i realized you  know that uh i am different and i'm okay  with my difference  so when you are confident about yourself  when you act self accept yourself then  what the third person is thinking about  me doesn't make any difference so that  gave me a lot of confidence and also you  know my first boyfriend whom i met in  college  that person made me realize that i'm not  the only one because i didn't have  internet access then  so when i saw that okay there can be  people like me i was already  self-accepted myself then i saw a third  person and you were like okay you're  huge was i'm like like both of you said  you talked about being effeminate as a  child right so did uh arnab and that's  that was your journey to realizing that  you're gay but there may be so many gay  people who may not be effeminate as kids  right  for sure i mean  this is not a formula there's no see  over the years we have uh we have marked  that okay pink is for women blue is for  men we have gender we have given gender  to everything possible  we have given characteristics to  everything so these are all social  constructs  i was asking my sister she has equal  potential like me that why have you  never you know  done something else why have you always  been a school teacher because she's like  you know we have been blown up in a way  brought up in a way that no longer  school teachers  scope  a few professions that were accepted  yeah so which is ridiculous but then  yeah right  so coming back to you  then  where did you go from there when you  realized that okay you're a woman  but did the world around you believe  that just because you believe that  well um i remember coming out to my  elder brother first and um  i would just not come out to my brother  to my father because he was very strict  sorry one second i want to cut you there  and ask you one more question did you  have any  did you know of any um people from the  community at that age or did you have  any role models in your family or  someone who trained i mean not from  their family but then uh as i said in  class seven when i had access to  internet i started googling uh different  transgender people and the first one  came was miriam rivera so i think she  was killed or something later on i got  to know but then a lot of other girls  like um there's news that i would like  to say that uh carolyn cossey was one of  the first transgender james bond girl in  back in 90s so a lot of people doesn't  even know about it  right so i started following these  people's journey read about them i can't  imagine having nobody  to talk to about this when you're  realizing such a big truth about  yourself oh yes and depending on just  the internet all by yourself that must  have been  yeah so like you know like of course my  internet one my computer was my friend  so i used to come and um  understand and you know try to get  things out you know in my mind and  everything so i used to like you know  process it in my head  and then finally tell my brother in  class 8 i remember and  one find i just say the spawn series of  no use because you know you're just  trying to put me in a box which i don't  want to and then um  so i knew like my father would be  totally against it since um i like our  numbers you know he lost his father i  lost my mother when i was in class six  so you know like um so i was in a very  strict vigilance by my father as a mom  and a dad both  so then i was was he supportive of this  he i mean eventually i would say he was  but initially no because he would just  scare me that you cannot do this and all  um it was totally against it  but i found my way to leave the city and  come and started you left the city yeah  i left after my schooling  because i in class 12 i had to finish  saviors since he was for 12 years and  my father was you're going to davis  college and i'm like no i'm not going  because i have to stay back back in  calcutta under his vigilance  so  i had to just leave right so i started  applying for fashion colleges and he  made me sit for  clart exam eyes exam because he's a nice  person he's like you have to sit for all  these exams and i did sit for them and  um i just tick mark whatever i wanted  because i didn't want it to pass  was switching cities was this one reason  that you could not live your life  definitely yes my relatives were not  that friendly as well because they also  had been not great towards my family so  my father had to see a lot because of my  behavior like imagine in back in  calcutta we have this ritual um i'm sure  that you know when we have saraswati  puja we all cousins come together and  then we're having drug puja in my house  from 10 15 years by then and my cousins  would not be like that friendly with me  so i would be like oh my god like it's  so bad right  it must have been very very hard yeah  even for you ernab like growing up  because  i'm guessing now your mother is very  supportive of it but i mean  right now everyone in the family is very  supportive including my cousins uh  probably ankush i would say uh because  it was way long back  i uh i generally don't blame them  because they were not aware  but because they were not aware i  i can't really say that i was not  tormented i was tormented because i the  problems that she just mentioned i have  faced similar problems and similar  issues in my life that you know uh why  are you dressing up like a girl why do  you want to wear a bindi  and at that point when i was in class  two and three i didn't know that okay  i'm not supposed to do it  i remember days where i was crying alone  and i could not even explain it to my  mother that you know why i was crying  because  i would be very ashamed i remember one  instance in my school i was in class  eight  my biology teacher asked me what is your  gender  she was making fun of me in front of the  entire teacher a teacher a biology  teacher  had it been possible i would have told  her name as well but then  because i named those evils yeah but  yeah yeah  but that incident was so scary for me  with 66 other because i remember there  were 67  students in the class  and others all other 66 people laughing  at must have been humiliating it was  very humiliating i don't remember what i  have done to  ask me that question and i might my  question right now would have been how  dare you and it was obviously done to  shame you and not to shame me it was not  a genuine question and  you won't believe me she was one of  those teachers in school whom everyone  would look up to she was dressed up very  smartly and you know she was one of  those fancy teachers i would say and she  asked me this question but till date  that incident is there in my fresh in my  mind yeah do you ever get like for  example i was also bullied as a child  and i feel that now i have overcome all  of that but one mention of these  incidents and they're very fresh in my  memory yeah so is it the same i'm sure  it was well um since our numbers  mentioned biology teacher i mean let's  not name these evil spirits you know  first of all so good for them actually  right now  right now yeah so you know what happened  over here was uh i had a teacher who  would imitate me in front of my 50 other  art students  so when that time i was in class 10  my icsc was on the way so  i remembered i think it was a maths  class or  yeah it was let's um let's not get into  too much of details as well so the  teacher comes and i mean i as a normal  student i would just say that i had a  question for  a certain number you know for like for a  certain subject right the syllabus so  then uh like he would imitate me  so you know i mean that's like and the  entire class would laugh  imagine teachers doing this they're  supposed to teach you and they're  supposed to be good role models  wow so the enter class would laugh and  you imagine that the teacher is there  for 40 45 minutes and teaching and he's  gone so what i'm going through the rest  of the day from 9am to 3pm so you know  they would just um  you know they would do the same thing  because you know teachers are supposed  to be teaching students so if you're  teaching this to bully others you're  adding on fool to fire so that is  exactly  transphobia homophobia it's not deep  probably those teachers didn't realize  what they were doing no probably that  same teacher would behave completely  differently right now because i'm sure  she's a well-read woman and she wouldn't  evolved she has evolved so in my case i  most of the times you know uh pardon a  lot of people thinking that okay it was  way too back but that teacher i could  not pardon honestly  for example  now your parents are supportive of your  parents supportive yeah i think the  tables turned for me after i uh when my  father saw the first article in calcutta  news that i was the first kolkata trans  woman to win a beauty pageant so that is  where my turning point happened  so my father would um i remember not  speaking to him for quite a long time  because for him it was very hard to  understand that  um you know his son is a she now right  so  he tried all his best so  when you transitioned do you remember  the day when after the transition you  met your parents oh yes yes so i think  um the best part of my life was when um  when i won the pageant in 2017 and once  again for all the listeners transition  meaning that you underwent a surgery  surgery to call myself a woman okay i'm  just like like a physical surgery a  physical cemetery okay so you know buzz  what happened was when i went back to  calcutta so what happened was um  i met him right my father so for the  first time in human flesh he saw me like  that and  i met all his um  his colleagues  and the most shocking people  yes i met all his colleagues and they  kind of you know like inaugurated me  with the flowers because i made my  father proud right and there were other  ice officers high police officers and  everything and out of which one i used  to call g2 when i was young like g2 uh  in bengali we say that so  he comes and he was crying okay i think  he was not drunk then so you know he was  not drunken  he was he was crying and holding my hand  and his wife was there auntie was there  so it was only my hand i said uncle why  are you crying and then  he says then you know what natasha when  i was young  you can imagine when i was young he's  like plus 60 right  i kind of um  wore my mom's  my sister's frock  and my father would come and beat me up  beat my [ __ ] out of me that evening  right so  seeing you i realized that  what you have changed in our minds  so i think that gave me a lot of courage  and that's impact that's a huge impact  and i was i had to use in my eyes and i  was i'm getting goosebumps right now  because i think that incident was very  touchy in my in my mind that time i just  want to say i'm very very proud of you  yeah thank you honor i think one small  uh you know point which i want to make  crying  do you not think that sometimes i'm not  defending people but i'm just saying  sometimes sympathizing may be a way of  them showing support or is that not how  you're supposed to i think you should  show support we are talking about  equality no one wants normalizing and  normalizing the more you will sympathize  the bigger the problem becomes because  it's always you're always looked in a  different  look with a different special place  are you saying that if you tell someone  that if you come out to someone or if  you tell them your story  what is an appropriate response is there  any i mean i mean  depends also uh generally i would not  tell my story to everyone for i can give  you a small incident which happened  yesterday after podcast  i mean but then uh  i came out to a colleague like very very  uh you know  normally without any without much hustle  and but he didn't react and that's  exactly the reaction we want he didn't  react he didn't say anything but i was  thinking  you're so used to being giving you  some big thing has happened oh my god  it's fine to just have uh being gay is  okay  it's you know that you know so i was  talking to this uh trans person once and  she told me that  according to her it's very personal  that's what she said she said it's very  personal but i like the reactions where  there is no reaction  because that's the only time where i  feel like what i look like what my  identity is not a point of conversation  i tell people something they they're  like okay cool  and yeah that's normal that's  normalizing it in the real estate  absolutely according to her the younger  generation  they don't they care i mean most of them  the the i would i would actually not say  the younger generation in in total  because obviously we're talking about us  we are talking about a certain section  of the society  educated aware of you know social media  exposure exposure lives in metro cities  those those handful of people they don't  react  but is this the same uh you know  condition all over india all over rural  india i'm not sure i'm not sure of  course  i get on uh you know social media every  day  by putting up very simple stuff people  you know come back saying that you know  you are great you are a hero i said i  don't think i have done something  supernatural but those things trigger  you know those things make a huge impact  in their life but imagine  when like it's so interesting that you  said  supernatural thought but interesting you  embracing yourself  is seen as an act of heroism because  that's the right that's where we are  right i'm just being me  and that is supposed to be a statement  in itself because most people are not  allowed to be there right right  like  as much as i'm proud of you i also feel  um  people are not allowed to be themselves  yeah i mean many people call me  privileged for that i think we are  privileged but  how we best utilize that privilege is  also something in our hand i mean i can  give you a small example which one  activity we did in our office so just to  give context arnab uh  just company manufacture he uh does a  lot of work for the community yeah yeah  what what do you do total background so  i work in finance but then i also uh you  know lead the lgbti wing in my company  so  that way uh we have done a lot for  social inclusion of uh the community uh  but then in as a part of the activities  on push i would just uh just tell you a  small example uh we asked people to wear  nail polish on their you know one of the  fingers and ask them to hide throughout  the day  most of ninety percent of the people  came back with a horrified experience  that i can't hide my finger  imagine a gay person hiding his own self  throughout her or his life how difficult  it can be  you can't hide one finger i'm hiding  myself all over you know every every  time i come out  wow  i think they'll understand how it how  does it feel it's a great maybe a  fraction maybe a fraction i mean just  paint one of the fingers and then i ask  you to hide don't show this finger to  anyone throughout the day come back to  me and tell me how you feel tomorrow  running into their running into your own  shoes i really hope all the listeners  listening to this right now  well i think um  definitely yes thinking  it's a mixed feeling why because um i  think of course  little bit change has been  visible but then we are not 100 yet  could we have had this conversation if  it was not decriminalized  [Music]  you could not even openly i think see  being gay was never uh  was never a criminal act uh i mean  having uh being caught in a being caught  in a sexual position with a person of  same i mean same uh you know orientation  or same gender i mean not the right term  same sex same sex that was uh not uh  legal okay but then again we had other  laws joe  those were very complicated natasha what  do you have to say about this i think  have you decided yes or no of course i  mean little as i said i think i  mentioned you like little change has  been there but uh our number is right as  well like you know by education is  something that should reach each part of  this land so everybody understands and  what it is and without knowing how will  you know who is gay who is trans person  like you know till date i would say that  uh in 2022 if i go  uh to a village and someone will not be  if i tell or someone gets to know a  trans woman i think there'll be  reactions still because education is not  reached in that land on that part of  india legally problem near  socially yes i think society society  wise there's a lot to do  we have not even near the ten  legally problems  because uh yeah  section 37 decriminalizes homosexuality  but it has not given us equal rights we  can't marry we can't uh have inheritance  of property uh we can't divorce we can't  do a lot of stuff inheritance is  property in returns a property from i  mean if i have a partner there is no  inheritance of property of by the  partner  how it is in the cisgender yeah partners  so there are multiple issues still there  so i mean whether i want to get married  or not that's a personal question  probably i don't know  but i have to i should have the option  of saying yes or no  so i'm not very sure so i would not  comment about surrogacy and adoption so  i think there are problems there as well  so legally are we there we are not there  um  i want to ask you this  after you transitioned mm-hmm um  it obviously changed the way you look my  life's changed yeah your life changed  right  has dating been  more difficult after uh  you know  your transition  so you know i will uh say that uh dating  live of course um  being on like of course i used to use  few of the social apps too  we're humans we want friends we look out  for new people  so then when i was like you know swiping  on you know men in the town  so there were times that um  i would get a lot of swipes because of  my pictures or maybe some guy likes me  or  but the way i look away i talk whatever  so you know someone has liked me and  then then comes the hard part  so before that hard part comes i've kept  in my mind i used to mention transgender  women  so i don't want to our question that in  in a separate part does it put you in an  uncomfortable spot when the conversation  gets to there because you know what my  imagine i'm dating a sweet guy tomorrow  and  um a heterosexual guy  so  if the person doesn't know about my past  i have to say eventually right because  i've had a  incident like this back in bomby where i  was dating this guy so i just randomly  met him at a club in south bambi and uh  so he didn't know about me we met at a  club loud music and everything so he  didn't know about me and then eventually  i found that he was having feelings for  me i would hang out with him for coffees  and everything so eventually i had to  come out to him and tell him so then  it's like i'm liking the guy as well and  if i tell him i'm transitioning so my  what the hell is this oh [ __ ] so it's  of course it is so you know i think  dating side very few people will  understand they have this mind like  a heterosexual guy in my  historic movements and everything that i  would have understood that is the guy  would ask you  why are you operated or you have you  have you been through the process have  you not been through the process or you  look operated this is the kind of things  that i've got because okay how are you  so possible right so that's possible  like someone cannot understand that  you're a transgendered person  okay yeah i'm sorry  so i'm guessing that  the situation would be much worse for  some men it might not be possible right  and that is where my voice was for my  international pageants that i said that  you know  my voice for all those girls my heart  goes out to them  because i've seen a little bit maybe out  of hundred i've seen twenty percent of  it someone who will go through this  eighty percent of it is so hard  their life is said  to say  maybe or possible aspect  what is your opinion on that because  isn't that also kind of celebrating  possible as a trans person so you know i  think beauty pageant um would say like  since i was in the india's first  transgender beauty pageant so i think  that was fine india so i think  personally that  video pageants are done to empower the  community at this point of time but at  this point at this point of time but  eventually when i go to 2040s 2050s or  beyond that i do see pageants where all  genders are  being celebrated you know so we are  going there  over time  so like if we can only if we say that  let's do miss india for everyone there  will be a problem now because right now  the education has not reached every part  so you know what is specified pronouns  when i say specified pronouns it means  letter do you see me and you will say  okay i'll address her as she her hers  that would be my first reaction reaction  because of the ideal condition condition  right when you see our number it will be  him uh his right so what happens over  here these are called specified uh  pronouns apart from that there are  people who want to be dressed as they  that them right so  uh  non-binary they don't want to  necessarily be called a man or a woman  basically in the binary system they  don't want to focus  so generally the term generally is very  important a cisgendered man would say  that he has his pronouns as he him his  cisgendered woman would say my pronouns  is she her hers so basically  if you were assigned female at birth and  you identify as a woman so  generally generally she would say that  my pronoun is she her hers but there can  be conditions that she might not  right exactly gender is something which  we  identify  these are the traits of a man he looks  like a man uh the short pant  penis but then uh ideally i would say  that in most of the cases they are  correct but there are cases uh where you  are not correct and in no way if it's a  10 percent that doesn't mean that they  are not important of course they are  equally important so  you know we don't know enough people who  have come out as right anything so if  you're not confident what i feel unquote  even  many a times i face situations where i  was not sure that what is the correct  pronoun to use  very politely and there are ways of  asking you can ask that listen mr x or  mrs white or miss x miss by joby okay  i'm not very sure  sorry mr and mrs  the first question you ask every time  you meet someone yeah  every time you're confused  i think you know i'm i have a solution  here just trying to oh there's a  solution you know the best way to put it  politely is like tomorrow i see someone  i would say hi good evening what are  your pronouns or how can i address you  as yeah how politely you can ask but  so i just want to understand  how do we make this a thing that people  actually follow  okay um you know what i mean i mean see  again there's a uh i see  educated  working class  probably they are aware of  if you ask you know someone  not within the specified spectrum that  okay you ask me my pronoun before they  will say what [ __ ] is talking  right so it's easier said than done  but there should be a starting point it  has already started in uh in one  location  in one in one section of the society it  has started  uh and we should uh we should try  encouraging it more but then uh how fast  we can do it is a very difficult  question and also  you know  not practical it's not practical i mean  because every conversation doesn't start  like no and also  if  mother  intention  genuinely interested if you really want  to know ask it otherwise don't really  i have a i have a uh i would severely  mind if someone wants to behave very  inclusive in public and show that oh my  god i'm aware of it and ask what is your  preferred phone number she actually he  or she gives up you know doesn't care  and they don't use them properly don't  use them properly just to be cool  you don't have to ask it ok  so  especially someone who's not very  sensitive about these topics and hasn't  read a lot  she okay this person's pronouns are not  he him  looks like how a man dresses but  the pronoun  like do you apologize do you i do okay  of course okay in a corporate sector i  do think yeah but not all i mean i think  it should be in regular life as well so  i apologize yeah i'm so sorry to you  know but dress you as that so thank you  for making me correct i think how  beautiful you can say that also you know  in many we are trained that how gender  neutral we can be instead of saying that  hi boys and girls hi ladies and  gentlemen  just  i'm addressing you too as guys  guys so tell me so in my office if you  write an email with hi guys we have the  right not to respond to you  wow yeah you always have to use gender  neutral language like hi friends and  folks which is no gender someone someone  wrote an email that to the chairman  and the email was declined because it  should be chaired person not chairman  how willing are you to learn  because  i wrote one email saying manpower  planning  my manager declined the meeting saying  make it resource planning because  manpower yeah so gender neutral terms of  the way yeah like hello people it's the  safest  yeah fair yeah and i also think that if  you know you're addressing a crowd  okay if you just say hello folks hello  people everybody feels included yeah  exactly  right  you know what i mean yeah very good  point you know i think psychologically  you feel well i'm a part of it yeah yeah  you're addressing me as well and enough  so about coming up let's talk talk about  sorry coming out let's talk about coming  up how how difficult is it has it been  for you to come out versus like in  general also how difficult i'm sure you  know a lot more stories of  you know queer people how difficult is  it really to come out  it depends on a lot of social and  economic uh you know condition because  uh most of the time financial financial  conditions because for me it was  difficult because  i was not sure uh you know how my family  would react  it wasn't i mean many people would say  that okay you are privileged and you  have a you know you have a very easy  life but then uh i wrote my own story it  wasn't very easy in the beginning  because i also had my share of you know  humiliation and cross questioning and i  was also taken to a doctor that you know  is my son you know  what what is he saying  so but then uh with education if i could  change the mind of my mother and also i  come from a huge joint family with 300  you know relatives with the same surname  i have  successfully changed all their mind  they're very very comfortable with you  know the queer community the lgbtiq  community they know a lot about it  because i have spread word about it so  uh  now it is easy but coming out was  difficult it is still difficult for most  of the people in india  i think it's also very you know personal  decision whether you really want to come  out or not because if a straight person  is not coming out and calling out loud  in public then i don't think uh  straight insane  i see my intention is very different  because i am very comfortable i want to  talk about it because there should be  someone who should be talking about are  you willing to make that i'm willing to  make that impact not everyone is  comfortable so  coming out not coming out is something  you know very very personal but it is  still very difficult  when you decide to come out to someone  see i generally i don't look at any  quality i come out to everyone because  i'm just being me  so as i said that in a gym i would still  say oh my god this guy is hot and  obviously my you know it's all almost  like coming out  and then the one question is  and whether you accept it or you don't  accept it it's your problem it's not my  problem  after  you transitioned  right and then they meet you again so  how has that been like because it's like  you have made the change that you wanted  to mm-hmm and you have accepted yourself  but bakilo bibi  still lagging behind  so i think um you know like a lot of  people have uh  my like out of 10 friends five has been  lost  in that journey he lost friends yes  because transitioned because i  transitioned they had a problem or  they couldn't take me  whatever you've done you've done with  your body with my body but then they had  a problem i don't know why i still  figured out some time but i tell that  that i think the universe pushed them  out so you're glad  i'm glad good actually it's good  riddance yeah so probably you know  something was there in the karmic  connections it's gone so i think it's  good because you know if they couldn't  have accepted me during that time so  there's so many other trans women they  will be coming across will do the same  thing right so what's the use  and also let's talk about they don't  want to grow let's also talk about  how unsafe life is for  trans people in general  like i mean you could still afford the  surgery you could  eventually get there but there are so  many people who struggle for like  shelter right there's so many of them  that we see on the streets mm-hmm and  they have also been kind of what's up  and you know it's almost become  it's become an insult word  as a trans person what do you want to  say because  but people who are struggling out on the  roads also  whatever traffic signals pay red lights  life must be really hard for them right  of course life is i'm sure because you  know  um i was doing this uh documentary on uh  the transgender life when i was in my  media college in uh calcutta so what  happened was uh that was my first year i  remember that was my project right so  i literally went shona garcia is one of  the most  highlighted places in the world like for  uh prostitution and for red you know  these work so he went there and i saw  this uh you literally get 15 rupees  a person in a night to millions of money  over there so you saw these trans girls  who are standing and  i on purpose went and i asked because i  wanted to know that johnny to one of  them i asked and she was like going to  get a meal for like you know for a night  by sleeping with someone it touched my  heart like why would she  do this you know why does she has to do  this and go through so much of pain  right so i personally feel that um this  is happening because insensitivity  towards the community first second would  be lack of education again comes back  third is the government how much of  extension of hand the government is  giving as well  talk about being gay and what are the  things that people don't understand  about gay people  i mean uh i'm gay but then i'm not  sexually frustrated  that's what i want to say because the  moment you come out to a straight man  i'm like i have faced this so many times  in my life that i'm getting like oh  don't touch my listeners  there are different kinds of subtle  homophobia i mean you know  you accept a  gay friend but you don't accept your gay  brother  this is  great you know i'm one of those liberal  mothers i wouldn't mind my son being gay  next day when the sun comes out i have  this example in my family she howled and  cried my son is gay my son is gay i know  what happened to those dialogues two  years back  huh so uh those are subtle homophobia  there are there is subtle homophobia  within the community too there are many  gay people who would say  are they  typical  you are not you know this is not one of  those behaviors this is all the  homophobia what is typical  who is gay he dresses up like he doesn't  have any traits  uh which is like visibly you know just  straight passing by and then you would  say why do you so typically this is also  a homophobic behavior homophobic  dialogue i mean  you're too gay for our liking huh you  know so there can be  and what about like what are the common  things that people say to transphobic  you know what i mean  there are various ways you can show it  one is uh which i have faced with silent  discrimination  when i used to work and when i started  working at a company so i would like  initial days when i transitioned i would  definitely feel that you know i was not  a part of the company when people are  having dinner you know lunches together  and everything i would not be called  because in oki or she's transitioning i  don't know what is she doing  this typical mindset of having that oh  she's transitioning means means she's  sleeping around  i'm sorry i'm not available for everyone  you know there's likings between people  right so you know that mindset i think  this these are like what transphobic  behavior end of the day because you are  not playing a part to be together when  you're having lunches to talk to your  fellow colleagues and everything and the  second is i definitely feel that  transgender means easily a lay down  that's the wrong conception i would just  not want to sleep until it's without the  consent of two persons why would i get  attracted to every man i have my choices  i have my free will towards the mind so  i think that is one so and then third is  like you know i feel that um  this is changing i believe because with  my uh experience of dating then till  last few years um and i shared this with  my partner as well that earlier things  were like oh she's a trance means  let's meet her at the corner understand  her this and that and everything but  things are changing on that so that's a  transphobic behavior  you know the moment that you see someone  trans transitioning transgender like you  like oh my god i don't want to be  hanging out with the person and  everything but you want to sleep around  have a good time so that's wrong  so i was already discussing this with  natasha um  which is why i'm asking this um can you  do you mind telling us about your  surgeries and the whole process of  transitioning because  like we've already understood key  transition  for a trans person it's a very personal  choice yeah again i mean it's person to  person like whoever wants to do it can  do it whoever doesn't want to do it it's  fine like it's end of the day but for  people who may want to do it  what is  what are the things that people need to  understand about the whole process of  transitioning and the surgeries and  right so i think um i will place it like  this that first of all surgeries are  hard you know when you undergo surgery  it's not easy because i have with my  experience of surgeries i would say that  my pain began from the time my  anesthesia was over that is where the  pain begins because you know  yes the pain and everything comes right  because once you're in the ot table you  don't get to know you just like they put  sedation and you're gone right you're  just um senseless so i think you know  over here i would say that um  the surgeries i've i've gone through a  series of surgeries so first one being  just one month late first they do some  um hormonal hrt it's hormonal therapy  for rigorous three years  yes that is the first one because uh  during operations  of course that's before the surgery so  what is the first step the first step is  you go to the psychologist and the  psychiatrist  you start having a friend to start  talking right you start talking to them  they tell you to cross dress  that how comfortable are you to to wear  those dresses and feel how women how  women you feel so the cross-dressing  part comes once the green signal is  given by the doctors the psychologist  and the psychiatrist so once they feel  that yes she's ready i remember when i  used to go to my psychologist and  psychiatrist she would make me turn into  the wall and she would sit behind me and  talk she said natasha don't see me just  talk to the one whatever i ask so i went  through that process for almost uh three  years oh i mean because you know they  understand because you know they don't  want a child or a person to transition  and regret a lot of girls who are doing  this at this point of time after  surgeries they are not happy right there  are lots of cases like this so they want  to be 110 sure because it's a it's  non-reversible process right right so  that's an important decision yes so of  your life so that is where exactly when  you know then it happens that their  charity happens where your physical  attributes changes right your body  becomes tender your skin becomes softer  you tend to look there's a point when  you will not look manly and you'll not  look womanly that's few months i mean  half a year when i i was so uncond i'm  uncomfortable going out because people  will judge you see you so you it changes  the way you look yes because your  feminine  aspects come out you look softer your  hair goes goes less grows there's a lot  of things to it i'm going into the  details so you know you look very um  very effeminate by looks your hair is  not grown it's healthy and you have your  laser sessions because you don't want  beard luckily i didn't go too much so  you know i had less hair but then a lot  of people who has to go right this  friend of mine who wants to transition i  told him that you need five black rupees  for your laser because this huge light  and beard so you know these are the  things that is then then after that a  lot of people wants to go for body  correction  like um  changing the body contouring  you know  so then you go for your srs  the sex reassignment

The Man Company,What are your thoughts on the relevance of rupaiyya? | What's Hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIkzfXnpEXs,"[Music]  what's hard Mumbai we are here at the  beautiful Phoenix Market city kurla  today for a very special reason we have  an exciting edition of gupt shop in  association with the man company in  store for you where we will be talking  to Mumbai key ladies and gentlemen about  some very interesting yet relevant  topics and trust me today's topic is  quite relevant  [Music]  but how many of us are actually smart  with our money Pennywise pound foolish a  penny saved is a penny earned we have  grown up hearing these things right but  do we really understand their meaning  taxes or Investments  [Music]  so today let's talk to some people about  their Investments what Financial  Independence means to them and if they  are able to save money in a seamless  manner do you guys have any Investments  and if yes  what are those Investments frankly we  know I don't I don't invest money I  don't  need to  come here and spend the money I don't  believe Investments are restricted to  properties and shares and stuff like  that Investments  yeah I have some Investments I recently  bought a house so a big investment  the biggest one  I have investments in Gold bonds mutual  funds then Equity is in the share market  what are the best ways to invest for a  beginner a person who's just starting  out so we must have heard the tagline in  mutual funds they're here so I guess  that is the best  investments yeah stock stockings  to see the short-term higher return  policies and into cryptos and share  markets I think I go with something  that's something like gold that's time  tested what according to you is a good  percentage or a good part of your  monthly income to invest  I would say at least 10 I mean I think  the younger you are  um you can put in less but I think you  know if you're starting say it 35 or 40  then of course you got to put away more  at least 15 to 20 this is what I feel  like ten percent  monthly 20 okay 20 yeah dependency again  depends I buy I was throughout smiling  because I spend my money I love spending  my money that's the reason I work what  according to you is the right age for  anyone to start investing  the moment you start learning that is  your age I can just say that  because there is no such Edge like as  early as possible start from a younger  age I guess because people are age tend  to start earning and then their first  go-to is oh they're going to spend all  the money out not realizing that then  that habit is never going to come in  yeah  whenever you're ready I think once you  get your first job yeah  my son's 14 and he's already talking  about starting that's right  they can do it right away yeah break  that psychology of Hope the Market's  gonna take my money away start slow and  steady but do because these are the big  things in that crypto I think in the  next five ten years we're going to use  it at GP and paytm either of you  you know initially when Bitcoin started  he was the one I think in the pilot team  and stuff or used to tell me it's gonna  be big you want to invest no  you can at least like 10 to 20 not more  than that because they are highly  volatile no I have no knowledge about it  okay at the end of the day it's it's  your psychology how you look at it and  people have like shares for a more  stable growth cryptos for earning more  so yeah like don't put all your eggs in  one basket never do that I would say  personal experience food never do it do  you think that the younger generation is  smarter about Investments and savings as  compared to the previous generation of  course a very big hand is the social  media or a digital platform too it's the  same I think you know as I said the  younger generation have a lot of ideas  whether or not they're practical I guess  really will depend on their risk  assessment and you know things like that  right right now people people are  getting aware about equities mutual fund  you know bonds and all other things so  they are pretty mature in investment  yeah of course foreign  nothing better than you having your own  money and whenever you want to spend  wherever you want to spend your juice  you don't have to ask you know anyone  you can just yeah since we are doing  this video for the man company uh  defined for me in one word the concept  of the modern gentleman  all of you smart caring  and family oriented do you want to  Define myself  in one word I'd probably say

The Man Company,Beard Grooming Habits | What's Hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYfSaavCJ_8,this beard I have not shaved it for the  last I'll be completing 10 years next  year my name is nikhil and what else you  want to know  if Interruption is starting  anyway trimming is something that I  follow every day  [Laughter]  what's hot viewers missed me  and I'm on the lookout for hunky men  with Gorgeous beards to learn a thing or  two about their pure grooming habits in  association with the man company so come  let's ask around what beard style do you  find sexy  um I think it's French only because I'm  that's the only thing I can grow  actually so I like the French beard yeah  long beard one with the cone that I find  sexy  are you are you aiming for that yeah  yeah yeah I'm aiming for that raw don't  do anything about it  just the one I'm uh wearing right now  the one beard sir it should be trimmed  uh like my style only which I have  recently any beard like I think it's the  base level is that if it's a beard  that's all it takes yeah it just has to  how about I think I like a stubble no I  I think I like the caveman thing better  like the full grown not very long but a  subtle look  what do you prefer uh for your own  styling an old school razor blade or an  electric shaver uh electric trimmer  electric shaver for me I think an old  school's razor because I don't really  use the entire thing the electric one so  yeah oh electric shaver and electric  shaver  uh easier to use and you can get it on  the get-go that's that electric shaver  definitely that gives Supercuts uh old  school yeah yeah old school razor blade  which has both sides I think uh electric  shaver because it is less uh you know  work for me what is the one beard  routine that you follow every day  I think trimming  trimming is something that I follow  every day  [Laughter]  that you guys have a lot  not at all not at all not at all no I  don't follow every day like it's one in  a month once in a month or that way not  every day I feel that beards are  supposed to be scruffy it's supposed to  be like a anti-establishment thing so  like not doing anything about it it like  that's the routine I follow  I apply oil  nothing really I don't have any weird  routine  yeah yeah  maybe just uh you know if it goes out of  shape I just cut it with a pair of  scissors awesome uh I put oil on my  beard the beard oil that's for sure  every day every day I don't have a  routine  like you said yeah yeah every day I just  wash my beard properly and then clean it  and share like uh combat  just to give that shape  so hygiene basically the most important  yes I usually apply beard oil but that  too if I grow that long but normally  again like current this current look is  very short I'm making this I trim like  every week so I don't have to put a oil  or shampoo or such  name one celebrity who's beard you  absolutely love or you wish you had a  beard like that I like it it has to be  Hrithik Roshan and think of anyone right  now  so there's Yash obviously then  there is Vicky kosher then we sing  then yeah  and then there is a little bit of  stubble and yeah those are the top few  yeah I think I like Virat kohli's beard  actually that for me like that is like  perfectly well groomed one so yeah but I  can't get there so anyways  ranveer Singh Maybe  I think Bradley Cooper  he has a good beard  Shahid Kapoor always and racing I've not  thought about it but wait uh  uh Tom Hardy commodity he's got a good  proper full here  [Music]  one beard style for the rest of your  life  what would it be either a mustache or a  full long beard or long beard  that looks super good on me because I  look like a baby in clean shape no  mustache no clean ship yeah both  Colombia  [Music]  yeah  and not only the Mustachio I would like  to sport a mustache because I did one  recently so I think I like to choose  with the mustache with this one that's  unique  I don't like mustache it's just two  maybe I like it I may look like an uncle  if I grow a mustache so you know that's  right yeah long beard if I could grow  one  that's the problem yeah but long beard I  think yeah don't start shaving yourself  too young trim it first and then start  shaving yourself so that you have a even  hair growth and um  it just helps you in the longer run  because grass is not always greener on  the other side DIY I would suggest DIY I  think if you rely on someone else to do  this that's not the best way to go about  it best is if you do it yourself  probably trimming every day is something  that's good because it'll give you a  better growth I feel and I don't use a  conditioner as of now but I think yeah  we use a conditioner to you know the  stubble won't be so hard it'll be soft  so it'll be exactly so yeah I think  that's about it shame every week  trim every week and put shampoo or  weirdo is a must  um just go to the salon you know just  don't do anything on your own I would  say because if you mess it up then  you'll have to clean everything off and  then you'll have to wait till it yeah to  grow back yeah that's that's the main  thing I would say what is what is the  one beard grooming product that you  absolutely swear by  well the man company I guess  I think beard oils beard oils from time  to time it's good for just maintaining  your beard and regular basis so that's  something else I think a beard  conditioner  yes yeah I guess I'll start using it  maybe then our bonus question for you  uh like I said I like a stubble no no  never clean shaving so clean shaven men  look naked to me I think the face has to  be you know it's like the gay now of men  more than Myriad a clean shaven and why  any comment on that bye I feel them to  be young without fear could not exactly  stumble a bit more than that but I think  a full beard is just way too much I like  more of like a youthful but not too  boyish sort of look today I've had so  much fun talking to people about their  beards and grooming habits I really hope  you guys enjoyed watching this video as  well but peeps don't forget to watch the  gentleman's show by

The Man Company,"Do you believe in love at first sight? 😋 | What's Hot",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkSHRPG4bJs,foreign  [Music]  He  Loves Me He Loves Me Not he loves me  he loves me not oh hey hi all you love  birds well Valentine's Day is just  around the corner so we are on the  streets of Delhi to find out if people  believe in love at first sight or do  First Impressions matter so let's go and  find out  so tell me do you believe in love at  first sight or falling for someone after  knowing them for years and why I feel  that knowing a person for years and then  falling in love for him is actually  pretty good because in that case there  is a better compatibility and a better  adjustment  for me it would definitely be calling to  someone after years of knowing them  obviously you can't tell in one day I  believe in love at first sight because I  feel like it's the universe's way of  telling us that they have something with  them oh I totally believe in in the love  at first sight oh why well I think that  love is just an emotion so it just  happened so then we do you believe in  arranged marriages or love marriages  love marriages oh definitely  oh now I believe in arranged marriages  like my father and my mother whomsoever  they will choose for me will be a far  more better person in all terms in the  present I don't believe either in love  marriage or arranged marriage both work  just fine my pick would be love  obviously because there should be choice  because I think in Magic there are  things such as where you don't have a  choice but I think it comes down to  marriage only I I agree with the orange  managers well if you ask me like a year  back I would have said love marriages  but as of the moment I have Supreme  faith in my parents so tell me would you  date someone older or younger than you  well not younger not older who is my age  I think he can understand me better no  not younger actually because I want my  partner to be more mature than me  definitely I don't think so age is an  area for not just for me but for  everyone as well for me wipes match only  I think that the same age is the best  match but well it loves and just happens  so yeah  perfume deal  uh that can enhance the smell of the  butt oh I think that a nice invitation  for food  it's the best plan yeah it's simple it's  emotional is is the best plan I think  commitment is the best gift okay that's  sweet  tell me what according to you is the  best Valentine's Day gift for a girl uh  understanding partner who can respect  someone is the best Valentine in their  gift he can give anything that is  personal to them like that reminds them  of the person that they are and their  respective Partners I think the best  Valentine's Day gift a girl can get is  her man showing her how much he  appreciates her to have a love song  written about you or a romantic book  written about a romantic book hands down  because that's a lot more detail so  kritika tell me one last thing if your  man was a fragrance what would he smell  like okay I'm a fragrance connoisseur so  I would say  um during the Summers he should have the  Sea Breeze and something very clean and  minimalistic during the winters  definitely something on the government  sense creamy and something like that and  during late night something special that  is just something I only know ah you  know when it rains yeah yeah so the  smell of that the mud okay that I just  love that smell so if my man would smell  like that which is I think not possible  a honey Bean oh that's sweet that's kind  uh sweet you know I think he would smell  like Sandalwood a musk and Patchouli  tell me one thing that is lovely and one  thing that is annoying about each other  annoying things she's very lazy at times  and if you love sleeping  the way she takes care of me and my kids  that's you know what I love about her  annoying fist would be he gets quite  irritating at time with his spontaneous  jokes and loving would be his caring  nature he surprises me a lot so he gives  me a lot of surprises annoying snoring  too many of my new things you know she  takes care of them even I don't and  annoying is  uh she's short-term so the one thing  that I find lovely about him is that he  is very caring excessively annoying  about him is that he never picks up my  calls whenever he is with his friends he  never responds to my text that's  something really annoying she respects  me my family and her friends also and  never disappoints me in anything but one  thing that will always be is she get  very irritated in small small things he  is very very much caring okay and  annoying  people is my leg every time one selfless  thing that he does for you that makes  you happy he buys me flaws oh that's  quite cute and what about you every time  it's like uh whenever I want something  or I just never ever mentioned it I just  want this or I like this she just  arrange it from anywhere no I can ask  her to cook me cook anything for me at  any time during the day and she'll do it  for me like if I'm lazing around he  won't disturb me so he'll take care of  the kids see house and everything so  that's right oh that's the best part I  wish someone does the same for me as  well okay so tell me one thing that you  found attractive in him when you guys  first met uh like her smile and uh it's  her cuteness she's so cute like he's  walking from there and I was like please  God please hide me somewhere he's so  cute I feel very simple her Simplicity  was the best thing his looks and his the  way he carries himself he was actually  very funny but now I am the one who gets  up roasted five years ago it was love at  first sight I think he is cute and I  really love his hair I agree yeah he is  cute tell me if you had to gift him  something special for the Valentine's  Day from the man company what product  would it be that grooming kit it's  really nice my friends have used it so  that beard while I'll give grooming kit  it would be a fragrance a perfume so  related to this only if your man was a  fragrance what would he smell like since  we both like donuts it's white chocolate  donut a Musky and Woody yeah uh I would  say vanilla vanilla and that's soft and  sweet yeah yeah  can you smell that well let me tell you  that love is in the air and after this  fun cup shop I'm sure you'll definitely  feel the same so if you want to get  something special for your Valentine  then log on to www dot themancompany.com  or download the app and shop for  exclusive Valentine's Day

Bell icon so  that the next time the episode comes up  you get a notification this brings me  actually to a very important question  okay so ideally it should be on your  pulse points pulse points pulse points  like like your wrist okay right  where it's pulsating right so you  ideally it should be your both your  wrists and the worst thing that people  end up doing is this  you're basically rubbing all the scents  and the chemicals together and it will  ruin it oh you are very much boy boy  looking  foreign  like there are a lot of boys who also  complain they reject us  [Music]  some friends on us because we are nice  foreign  Ty is a lot of times  means your power it's more about  male pleasure as per the patriarchal  society we are living in  but that is not right  hello everyone  with a big thank you for all the love  that has been pouring in regular  listeners  but I'm sure there will be more people  tuning in for this particular episode so  for them this is ankush bagna you have  tuned into the gentleman show by the man  company or yeah  and  we have with us a luxury lifestyle  influencer content creator and someone  I've known for like a really long time  now  hi I'm Chris how are you I am good but I  know that you're hating on us right now  he's like  that's not my first rodeo you know I've  done this before but how are you feeling  are you are you nervous it's so good to  have you on my first podcast I'm I'm  enjoying it when I got roped into this  and I was like okay ankush is doing it  Fab we don't need to break any ice at  everything yeah we've broken many cubes  of ice  there is no ice cream we've known each  other for years now and I feel that  episode  if we have enough with us so yeah it's  uh  okay okay let's just lose this here this  is very uncomfortable I want to sit like  this  so why I got you here was that this  topic is very interesting and you have  this image of being the luxury  influencer and you know he's very very  proper and everything  behind the scenes but behind the scenes  behind the scenes are very it's it's fun  to see the behind the scenes yeah that's  the thing I'm happy I'm going to be  candid on this one for sure I think it's  podcasts  I think that would be a reality show bro  yeah yeah and um  which is a very impolite question but  it's you so I'm going to ask you that  has someone ever told you that you smell  really bad  you know this is the thing I yeah 100  and uh just like anyone you know who  encounters a question like this you know  you really start questioning everything  you know [ __ ] like you know you you're  kind of like shaken away from your  comfort zone  so I was in a school trip I was I think  I was in 11th or 12th grade and uh over  school trips  right here and stuff obviously you know  it's like a full grade of school  students they are going past and stuff  and you know it's Summers and you know  as school students you know two into the  whole thing at least  you know was not available  yeah exactly like today kids are like  very into it  and at that time I remember this girl  very so I by the way I didn't study in  India I studied uh abroad in Brussels  there's no flex over there it's just  what it is but the point is that you  know I was always surrounded by you know  foreigners you know Americans Germans  and so on so this is very pretty girl  she was sitting I think behind me  like could you please put some deodorant  on okay you're stinking and I'm not  joking  that that thing you can take a man out  of India but you can't take India  but like I mean you know call it the  college care school kids you know your  your testosterone your hormones are on a  different Flex so that little tap was  like like you know and then suddenly  when she puts you down like that  playing in the background I saw where if  if that's the perfect song  and then you know the rest of the class  so did it become a joke it became a joke  for at least like you know half an hour  45 minutes or something which is  embarrassing you know for a kid also so  you're just like not talking to people  then I'm not joking it was just like  I was shocked that was the thing like I  normally am not like lost for words but  like at that time I was just like I was  put down quite badly situations  or like you know like it was just a faux  pas for the moment or something nothing  like that right I was like yeah was it  you enjoy my stink there's no other  choice but he was it body odor was it a  bad perfume it was body odor man because  you know it was like you were traveling  you know you're sweating and it's not  like okay it's just that galties  like what do you think what is your  opinion on this is it rude to tell  someone that you you know he's thinking  so there's a way of saying it exactly  there is a correct way of saying it see  I I think  directly you know by saying yo like you  know  stinking you know or like  or something you know so you know they  will automatically be like a little bit  more guarded they might just fight yeah  they get too defensive so there's a  polite way you know you might as well  take the person out on the side or  something and then just tell them that  by the way just do this thing and I  always feel that you should be a part of  like a solution don't just like put it  out demo [ __ ]  you know you're stinking and sat me you  don't have a solution for it and neither  does he then you know he's just you just  ruined his day pretty much did you  borrow someone so see you in the bus  then  but like I'm talking like in general  like sometimes it happens in the gym  you know it's like that like body odor  and I don't know like sometimes you know  men might skip a day for taking a shower  and then go to the gym sweat more and  then that body odor is horrible mother  your eyes start watering and but like if  you're in the gym you're course you're  carrying your deodorant you're carrying  perfume so you might as well give it to  the dude you know have you ever done  that I've done that yeah yeah 100 how do  you politely tell a person at the gym  you know I told him I'm like  wow there's a way of saying that it's  humor it's humor no so that's the thing  so like you just pull the guys  and do they take it like I mean that guy  took it very well okay cool yeah but  your gym is one place where you  understand what brought your can be yeah  for sure you know it's horrible it's uh  yeah but have you ever been like  disgusted by your own body order  um Yes again it's one of those  situations like me like I'm a big uh  Adventure nut right so I used to go for  like you know walks and stuff and you go  to nature trails and Hikes and you do  camping as well obviously camping a time  you don't have a choice of going for a  shower or dip at the max like yeah I did  try it once again going into the lake or  something that's your only other option  I didn't do that and then it was like  you know the whole day of sweat Grime  and all that kind of stuff it gets you  but then you are equipped with the fact  that okay you should use a Bollywood  like a deodorant and stuff to mask the  body yeah I also feed that  foreign  but when you're meeting people right  it's so humiliating so so you know what  my hack is so if I realize and it's  happened to me that through like the  course of the day I'm like you know what  I'm not carrying anything with me I have  sweat a lot and invariably I'm going to  be stinking right like you know as you  go to a mall and then go find like a  perfume shop or something or the other  but then but then I make sure I do one  thing I don't apply the thing on my skin  I apply it on my clothes so that kind of  Master because if you use a perfume on  your sweat and stuff then  um yeah  so perfume has to only be applied on  skin when your skin is like fresh yeah  when your skin is fresh and clean and  see that's the difference like you know  your your deodorants are basically  supposed to mask your body odor right  from like happening because you're going  to perspire your sweat is going to come  out so it helps with masking that your  perfume on the other hand is just like a  projection right it's like it's your  becomes like you're a little bit of a  body fragrance so like that two  how was it like when when we talk about  deodorants and perfumes I remember  suddenly there was you know an influx of  all these Brands and everything  yeah like I mean without naming the  brands like  the girls would come running to you and  all that and as teenagers and you see  that you're like oh yeah  you know you wanted a deodorant or your  parents didn't let you have it  I think  you know like my parents they genuinely  were like you know  and this is something that you it was  almost like it was being taught to me as  well that you know at least deodorant is  something that you should do because I  was I was very active in sports as well  in in school time so  invariably I used to have like a  deodorant with me most of the time  barring my the school trip but like  which I'll never forget scarred yeah  I think my first introduction to perfume  was  um  so my parents would not let me use like  deodorants and perfumes and stuff  correct and the only perfume is  foreign  foreign  so that's where deodorant comes into  play now the perfume part is to actually  make you smell better right so but then  like you said  you know it won't project as much yes as  the day goes by you know and sweat goes  with it and everything yes people will  not notice the sweat smell they will  notice something you know flowery or  citrusy or something however your  deodorant is but it won't be like the  same amount as like a perfume foreign  area so this way is like an all-round  projection like 360 degree 360.  okay  [Laughter]  yeah but okay so people also say okay  because it leaves like a nice right so  exactly so it's a trail of scent again  your back of the neck all this area  right it's it's you've got a lot of  arteries and you've got a lot of veins  over here so it's always pulsity it's  not just one pulse over here so science  student hey actually I was actually I  was good at biology and chemistry but uh  okay physics  okay  how much perfume is too much perfect how  do you define that  again trial and error ideally you should  not do like depends now you have edcs  you have um  so you have EDC which is your order  clone so that old o means Pani okay it's  a francaise it's a French okay  why why is this happening so so I order  clone actually clone clone okay  it's not one that's uh that will last  very very long projections  that's how long it lasts and then you  have your edts  so yeah your EDT is your audit wallet so  it's a bit more potent than your EDC why  is it called toilet  you'll have to find somebody French  really to ask these questions from but  uh so it's stronger than EDT is stronger  than EDP is their full form again  edit is always not always but like most  of the time is stronger than PC c order  cologne okay  less than tea  so yeah so that and then you have your  your edps which is your eau de parfum so  usme  concentration perform  buffoon  okay  a lot of luxury Brands actually have  launched their own deodorants as well  which is  yeah but yes ideally yes deodorant is  should not be saying that but I just  said it sorry  so yes I ideally as the deodorants are  as uh sasta option and then you have  your EDC and EDT I won't say key one is  less than one is more but yes edps  usually are a bit more expensive you can  make concentration  oils are the stronger ones and  strongness is basically dependent on how  long it stays on your body and uh how  much the projection is so if you're  looking at that then yes edps are more  and more expensive also usually more  expensive  cologne usually doesn't last very very  long although there are certain colognes  which go to four or five hours and stuff  a lot of Brands they've done good  research on this but uh your clothes  don't last that long edts yes some some  people actually it's EDT suits their  body chemistry more in fact more than  edps it also sounds like chemistry  equations  how many perfumes would you have tried  so far  a lot man  more than a hundred  but like what what makes you want to try  a perfume by like for example a new  perfume is launched yeah what makes you  want to try it like it's ingredient list  it's packaging what because a lot of  people buy perfumes because they look  pretty yeah they like to collect I love  the bottles correct correct correct so  for me it's more about the end product  your your fragrance hair so that's what  makes me want to try it out because  like I said like for me it's all about  the memories right like you know certain  fragrances they will actually remind you  of a place that you might have been to  or a certain memory that is associated  with that like I think they should come  up with a perfume that smells like a  bank balance to remind you  yeah so so for me it's more about that  and of course uh trying it out and uh  you know you feel good when you get  complimented on oh my God you smell  that's true that's true like when you  tell someone hey you smell good it's  such a nice compliment to hear also it's  a good compliment and I automatically  feel that if say the opposite sex or the  same sex is you know looking at you or  is interested in you I think by  appearance if you were a five you know  and then you smell too much  I don't know Midway five is okay  so if appearance you were a five but you  smell better you know your chances are  up six seven  eating weight helps it actually oh it's  attractive always no woman will say like  no woman will ever say that it could be  a fetish  but there'll be far few in between yeah  I mean everybody wants to smell good and  everybody is attracted to things that or  people that smell good so always I get  it but do you think this uh when men buy  perfumes it's mostly to impress  do you buy perfumes so that you smell  good on dates and  see mirror dating at times  but but yes even then it's for me it's  always about like you know like my wife  saying that you know oh my God this  smells so good on you and stuff and yes  that charges a lot of sexual chemistry  for you automatically so I know for a  fact that when I was single and I was in  the dating Circle yes  perfumes definitely perfumes  I don't know what Sheila did but but  definitely it gets you to the point  where you can use your shirajit  you do you also use perfume on a regular  basis when you know that you're not  going to meet people as such like for  example it's a regular day yeah do you  still wear perfume yeah yes sir  occasionally you know this is the weird  part I even spray a perfume before I go  to bed  so for me it's like that  no it it see the thing is again uh if  you have somebody who you're sleeping  with you know so it's and um again you  don't spray something that is so  powerful yeah you know that the entire  night the other person has a headache  right but there are certain perfumes  which are actually meant as bed perfumes  so you can actually spray that play  linen bed sheets pay they spray those  things so just so that you know you you  have a good aroma and you you know you  sleep better in fact do you always carry  a perfume with you to reapply it so  again and again so the thing that I  always end up doing is that I get a lot  of those trial value like from shops so  if I like a perfume I tell the guy that  you know give me a few of the trial ones  of the small one okay so if I'm going  out I'll just carry one of the small  ones do they give those to you when you  buy the perfume when you buy the perfect  otherwise they don't give it  foreign  ah actually good good question I  actually I'm not quite sure  but uh who knows you can try it I think  babies it's about I think it's about  confidence in the thing that you could  be a potential customer but if they know  then your your trick of always going  into a mall and it's confidence  confidence  but now I think I will but okay  um we're coming towards the end of this  podcast so I want to ask you would you  really say finally is would you say that  a perfume a good perfume or a good  fragrance defines a man's personality  I don't I don't think it defines a man's  personality I think it accentuates a  man's personality  I think you could be a fantastic person  you could be you could be the kind of  person who you know enters the room and  like you know all eyes on that person  you know it's not about looks or  anything it's just the the vibe the  energy that you bring to the thing right  this is like perfume and stuff something  is more about leaving that memory behind  right so it's more like your your  personality was fantastic but people  will also remember that you know what he  smells fantastic also and for a lot of  people who don't have that ability of  you know becoming like the life of the  party or you know becoming the light in  the room and stuff they can actually  leave an impression by actually smelling  good  so I think it accentuates your you being  a modern gentleman I think that was  beautiful when you said key it is uh  what people remember you by yeah yeah I  think that tears falling down your eyes  but this brings us to our next segment  which is called  I will say an ingredient and you tell me  the fragrance family  is something we've already discussed  Bergamo  mudish  okay whatever you saying so you can say  whatever see I'm giving it to you  according to how I remember I could be  wrong also it's not like I will remember  it was fruity no Bergamo can be fruity  it again whenever I've tried Bergamot I  can't smell bodyish to me with Eva  I always associate that with being  citrusy okay cinnamon cinnamon is spicy  yeah lemongrass  again you know I think I'd say spicy  so there is something called an internet  yeah what is it  so it's a fragrance but like what family  thank God I would like to say it's  fruity I love how nervous he is in this  round because the thing is you know if I  said you can't just remember fragrances  like just by the names also often that's  the only thing so I apologize if I'm  getting these incorrectly very safe  great I'm glad you did that  of course  but uh  before we end this uh very informative  and insightful episode on fragrances I  want to ask you if you had to define the  modern gentleman using just one word  what would it be  cultured  culture we've not heard that before but  I'll like explain this so I feel a  modern gentleman is always defined by  you know your mannerisms and your you  know like okay when you meet somebody  who is you know very pleasant person or  something you know you always say like  oh wow he's got a great upbringing you  know you're always credited to your to  the person's parents you know how he's  been brought up and stuff so I feel  deep down inside that's the beginning of  it that's how you become a proper  gentleman is how you're raised also as a  person so if you're cultured right if  you have the right values being  instilled into you since you were a kid  you're bound to become a Fab person  very interesting enough very insightful  not like philosophical side  view I was impressed with myself thank  you so much for giving this your time I  had a of course I had a blast as well  man yeah talking about perfumes and  hopefully uh you know we can persuade  you to smell some different perfumes are  you saying that I smell bad no of course  you smell musky white musky thank you  thank you so much I would take that as a  compliment but um thank you it was great  having you and uh thank you so much for  tuning in to this episode of the  gentleman show by the man company this

bahugna  you have tuned in to the gentleman show  by the man company  lives  conditioning which has made us believe  that even colors have gender like pink  is for girls blues for guys and to  discuss

param sahib singhanani  and then I add three to eight cookie we  are three men in the family  welcome uh thank you thank you ankush  thank you for having me on the show yeah  I'm feeling coffee excited or coffee  colorful as usual and tell me a short  picture  [Laughter]  you know you see this yes  and everything you know like it's good  to wear a man wearing a shirt like this  and flaunting something like this yeah I  mean that's it that's a style every time  uh so paraman I have crossed paths at  events and all but we've never actually  had time to like sit and chat so I'm  very glad for that and uh he's always  dressed in very quirky colors  you know he stands out in a crowd like  oh that is param I remember I saw you  and I could see you because everybody  was in like blacks and Grays and blues  actually to stand out yeah  I'm like okay I'll wear the brightest no  actually jokes about but actually uh  whenever I like choose my clothes in the  morning also every day and on a daily  basis also like  foreign  [Music]  the million friends and uh so in Tamil  you know param param is banana  Instagram Instagram  now even my checks  but um so like like I said before key  you're always seen wearing all these  quirky colors and you know a lot of  colors in one go but your shirt will  never have one solid color it'll always  have a lot of patterns a lot of pop pop  art Bulls this is inspired by yeah pop  art right so you tell me how has this  journey been how did you become a  designer  because I've never actually asked you  this we've never chatted um since you've  never chatted yeah so designer was  always yeah on my on my like to do  thinking life  you know like since childhood there's  always a back story  like I've had my story of playing with  Barbie dolls you know like investing my  uh piggy banks  and then uh scraps fabric I would make  their clothes you know like yeah like  most times  I would steal those things and then you  know like notebooks illustrations  and they were so scared back in the day  if I talk about 10 12 years back right  college  so choosing that and fashion hearing by  fashion  okay okay  and then I actually uh so a coaching  Institute they teach you for this  preparation for this and then so I kind  of took a loan from my dad only to pay  for that thing and then eventually  during my preparation the the owner of  that uh Institute told me why don't you  start teaching  then you can start paying your fee so  then eventually I repaid my own thing  and then I clarified nift and then I got  into it  there's been no looking back clearly but  uh param tell me one thing the way you  dress do you get like stared at a lot in  public places  and now I've gotten used to it now I  know that you know  so I know there'll be people staring and  there'll be people commenting pointing  fingers  they say that they say it and I can hear  it I have a very sharp uh  so I can hear it and I know that people  are talking and you know like I've been  through a  Journeys  [Music]  simple clothes get out change in the  washroom and then step out and then be  myself and then change back and then go  back home was there to avoid that  confrontation with parents with parents  also and with them also asking you know  like uh obviously I cannot blame my  parents kyunki  they don't know they have also never  been spoken or uh exposed to such things  they've also never met such kids or such  friends in their college in their  childhood who would just like dressed  like that and who would openly love to  wear it for them to accept their son oh  my God  you know something like that to avoid  those initial in the initial years but I  think there was to come a long way I've  also come a long way now I'd wear from  my house I step out and I don't care  okay now whoever is going to think  because it has kind of become my  identity so for example when you are  going to school that would kill you  because  [Music]  so imagine the trauma of the peer  pressure leave the school authorities  imagine the peer pressure  right in those days I can't imagine  and also I was not like I was not in a  sick school I was in like a uh like a  non-seek school so there I was the only  Sikh guy so over already would stand out  and yeah so and then  [ __ ] that would have been a lot of  bullying I mean sounds like there was oh  my God okay let's talk  uh but uh so while while growing up when  you didn't have access to like designing  your own clothes  pretty simple only yeah so then did that  kill you from inside images  we had like fix Shops going to like  kannada nagar market near my house or  like these markets  like by default choices  so you know like eventually like but  then also I would put my foot down again  mix and match so that Knack was also  there is but  um so you would say that the clothes  that you're wearing as a child the  clothes that you found them boring  basically I did and I I kind of worked  my way around to make them interesting  for me  you were not you didn't feel that uh  there were the kind of clothes that you  would want yeah  I was always wanting more um  you know something that I would love  wearing it  but like I would feel on top of the  world so you are you are someone who  loves wearing colors basically yeah  right so you tell me one thingy um this  whole notion that blue is for boys pink  is for girls was it a thing in your  childhood yeah yeah we all have grown up  watching these movies I mean I will come  back to movies cookie like we have grown  up watching those movies and Bollywood  it's such a big like uh  Blues  [Music]  I mean movies is one thing aside but  also like in families also they would  say  um  yeah you know they say very simple  things like that and I know  you know like pink is a very common  color even by men yeah but I still feel  that in a lot of in a lot of houses it's  still not as common like it's not an  option yeah  exactly parents are also pretty cool and  everything is like pretty exposure  you don't need to talk such things  [Music]  but we talk about rural India we talk  about India in like rural like Mars  India where like there are so many  families who does not even know all  these things  comes as a culture shock  they cannot accept it that is where the  like the child or the or the kids or  people start feeling like you know they  need to break out that's where the  clashes happen oh my God like your  opinions and that that that's why they  start hiding things that's why they  start like uh they want to talk about  these things they want you oh my God  like who can we rely on who can we find  as our role models yeah because if you  don't see people like you  then you feel kind of lost growing up  right I I probably am able to stand up  for myself Aaj I had nobody to look up  to in terms of Role Models while growing  up so I would really find oh my God  so I would rely to like those old  magazines  so I would get like validation so at  that point  you think we are you know this person  comes a little close to my personality  not even at that point no no because now  I think about uh you know just a  Bollywood the way celebrities dress now  yeah it really uh trickles down to the  audience and they get inspired also  they're like oh you know this is how  also I can wear things like for example  um I personally love ayushman khurana  style yeah because it's like for I like  it because it's not like a shocker yeah  because when I say like borderline  breaking it's edgy but it's not a  shocker also which is how I like to risk  if I go wearing something I don't want  all the heads to turn to me because  that'll make me very awkward but I want  anybody who looks at me to be like oh  yeah that's that's a cool outfit yeah so  that's my personal style which is why  like I'm glad when I look at someone  like an Iceman khurana I'm like okay I'm  I'm glad he's doing what he's doing  because it'll it also kind of made me  feel like oh I could also pull off that  jacket yeah  I don't think  I could never think I could also pull  that off that is why like people like  him and more people like men like him or  uh even more on the likes of uh him  they've come out and they've started  expressing them beyond the you know like  the limitations and definitions of what  man is beyond the boxes right so we look  up to these men so these are Role Models  I mean you know  yeah true and it's not even about only  colors it's also about the Silhouettes  you wear the Styles you wear because  also growing up in a middle class family  you don't have access to a lot of Brands  a lot of designer wear nothing actually  you wear the simple stuff you know short  or shorts and whatever so growing up  when you when you see people  experimenting with fashion it may it  makes you feel like here  you know maybe I want to experiment with  my style also yeah like the closest axis  in terms of like uh things would be at  at my house would be my mom's clothes or  my dad's clothes so you eventually end  up styling those things with your things  and then you see okay a chart this is  also looking fine and nice on me and I  can carry it off then why not experiment  more so uh param like I said that my  style has to be something like which is  not a shocker but it's still a little  edgy and it's like fun yeah how do you  define your style I've always been a  maximum  maximum list and uh sorry like I'll just  stand we're in between me like that is  also another thing that I really like uh  come a long way please I'm able to talk  in length now yeah so uh like I've  always loved to mix and match layer  things and put clashing things and uh  lots of like uh elements happening  patterns motives so I think that has  become like eventually uh my style and  like now I feel very normal into the  dead skin now I feel like that is my  skin so every time you dress up it has  to make a statement in the terms that  it's Max like it's it has a list you  know like uh so I don't think oh my God  like I have to stand on in the crowd but  I have to feel happy when I look at  myself in the camera or probably camera  they could you know feel like oh okay  now I'm satisfied so it's not like  it's just that this is what you feel  yourself in yeah So eventually those  stylish category attack that it just  gathers a lot of attention and eyes but  that is how how I do uh see that so  let's let's come back to the main  question which is do colors have gender  do you think colors have gender like  it's very silly to ask genders wow  thanks for telling me my question was  [Laughter]  you know like  orange you will say orange you know like  you won't say boys is blue and girls is  Pink So colors defining colors with  genders is very wrong it's wrong at the  basic level only hmm  but do you find do you see around you  because you're a designer and you I'm  sure you have clients and all  um  do you think that men find it very hard  to experiment with colors they don't  find it hard but they feel safe you know  they they feel that you know like uh uh  people will not come and question them  like they don't want to answer and  probably like put them on the  confrontation  I feel in a certain way I feel different  so they want to play it by save at the  end of the day black panther blue pillow  which are typically considered as male  colors yeah  I've actually never seen dulhas wear  pink for some reason you know there are  there are no like I'm talking about uh  I'm not talking about uh affluent  families who have resources I have  gotten clients who are crazy like freaks  freaks name  they want to experiment and Dulas are  more excited than Dulan they're like I  want to outshine my bride so luckily I  have been able to attract that audience  and for me it's quite an amazing  experience every time to work with such  people who who just give me like free  hand yeah okay  so when a when a woman wears like a pant  suit yeah it's seen as power why because  band suits you associate with men  corporate and those business class  things anything that a man wear means  power which is why when a woman wears a  pant suit or a short pant yeah you think  she's a boss woman she's trying to be a  man she's trying to be a man but like  she also gets compliments like you're  looking powerful yeah as if she can't  look powerful wearing a saree in a saree  and Ulta like for example if men wear  something that is like for example every  time someone wears a skirt a man wears a  skirt  he will not be called powerful he'll be  called  so exactly so even clothes have come a  long way in terms of gender I mean now  if you see clothes are gender neutral  clothes I mean we don't put labels as  men or women there are Brands who  certain certain brands who don't say key  this is for men and so that's you you're  talking about genderless fashion and  energy like we have just diffused  dissolved those borders  but there are certain Silhouettes let's  say skirts sarees which we obviously you  know come from the history of the  clothing and all that where uh we see  only women wearing it and also in a  household like only women wearing it so  naturally Aqua uh a clothing type  Associated  I want to wear a skirt it will look  pretty cool but eventually  reactions like  we see so many women be so comfortable  in wearing clothes that you typically  associate with men like buying suits and  everything but men aren't that free of  thin jackets boyfriend jackets those  boyfriends but men won't be comfortable  doing the same thing and so why is that  I you know it's all about you know like  like they feel threatened they feel  threatened key uh you know they will  feel less of a man yeah like what if  what if someone what if out of 100  people 99 people compliment them  so there you know it just Pricks their  ego it just like breaks that bubble Q oh  my God Mary masculinity Breakaway  right no I you you absolutely make sense  and I'm glad that you brought it up but  another thing that you brought up was uh  genderless fashion androgynous fashion  can you tell our listeners a little more  about  what do they look what does these  clothes look like and what is the idea  of it so genderless fashion is basically  you know like we don't Define Harmony  t-shirts and then they will do like long  dresses also which are like not defined  a transgender woman or like anyone  anyone comes a non-binary person yeah  like anyone coming from any walk of uh  Association of gender so they at the end  of the day they just want to make  clothes so the idea is that the idea is  that  the idea like a liking has to come if  you like the color you should just take  it if you like a silhouette you should  take it  so you should just take it so is there a  particular like the economic out they  look a little put like particularly in a  way yeah it could be or are you saying  that any cloth any piece of cloth is  agenda so basically  you know it does not have a structure  shape it's just that you mix and match  Silhouettes like it can also be fluid  flowy at the same time both  vibrant was uh uh like uh like flow like  a skirt and also it can be very  structured from the top so it can have  like both the features of ads we put in  men and women so don't know structures  so that is like a basic idea of  androgenous fashion so do you see a lot  of men  um you know accepting this yeah imagine  like men wearing black nail polishes men  wearing like nut  and uh men experimenting with the quote  like a basic quote case silhouette so  you know imagine like a long label or  probably like a drapey back so I say the  like small small features of experiments  are probably like men definitely want to  bring that twist into them makes sense  yeah but do you see a welcome change in  a lot of Welcome change like not like a  like like a baby step but men definitely  want to experiment and they don't I'm  not talking about celebrities no no I'm  talking about real people come on like  you know celebrities  they want to push a certain thing but  with real they're also the place let's  face it they're also at a place that  they have the power to influence yeah  like everybody who's a public figure  they all they have  activity  I'm gonna ask you a question and you  answer it okay uh the question is tell  us three things about the fashion  industry no designer will ever ever tell  you oh you have to say inside Secrets  they'll always keep you suspense till  the last moment  they need to absorb the feel of it  also they'll never secretly tell you  that they're secretly judging you always  their secret is uh judging your looks  and like just giving you numbers in the  head eight out of 10. miners  and I think they'll never tell you uh  uh that uh it was never easy for them  like I think they'll always tell you  that they've come to a point wherever  they are in their life with so much of  hard work and uh with so much of  struggle like is that false no I think  it's true  okay fair enough um thanks for that  answer and uh we're gonna close this  episode now uh but before that I want to  ask you one last question which is  Define the modern gentleman in one word  I think humility and civil uh uh  okay uh  chivalrous chivalrous yes  basically up you know  yeah  so you have to respect that a woman is  sitting there and you cannot share  certain things you cannot rely on your  mom to do all the things just because  she's a female in the family so that  chivalry has to come at the right point  that your mom or sister is doing  something you need to make do things for  them you have to respect that they are  also a human being they are female or  men you know like oh Dad sets the tone  of the family  you know like not just he has come from  work  but you can step up and you know become  like okay I will do this for you you  have worked all the day let me just do  this for you at the house so I think  that chivalry like that small gesture  and their understanding of uh you know  just to be more feminist and to treat  both genders and even Beyond equally  that has to come from the right age  right okay so actually I'm going to  throw this to the audience now I want uh  now you tell us in the comments how you  would Define the modern gentleman in one  word and  audio streaming platforms  Channel  episodes  and thank you so much for being here  thanks ankush did you have fun I had so  much fun I mean I would just like you  know say all these things but yeah I had  so much fun you know to have this  conversation my God this podcast is such  a great idea to talk about things which  is  what it is but um thank you for saying  that I'm glad that you enjoyed and um to  everyone watching this uh thank you so  much this is  from the gentleman show by the man

icon so  that the next time the episode comes up  you get a notification have you ever  felt that I'm dumb no no so that's the  answer a fat character's personality is  all about similarly another stereotype  here Jim boys personality is all about  Fitness oh you're a very much boy boy  looking  [Music]  um  like there are a lot of boys who also  complain they reject us  [Music]  some friends on us because we are nice  how fragile masculine tea is a lot of  times  means your father  male pleasure as per the patriarchal  society we are living in but that is not  right  [Music]  hello everyone this is ankush bhagna you  have tuned into yet another episode of  the gentleman show by the man company  [Laughter]  podcasts  which is the problem yeah I see it now  but what is the topic today do you want  to tell us what the top what are we  talking about today it's about Fitness  and Men yeah it's about men Fitness and  also you know there is a difference  between uh for example for example you  go to pranith's social media feed you  see one aspect of Fitness which is like  the you know  everything and then there are a lot of  people that you would look at and you'll  feel key oh yeah they're definitely not  fit and I think that there is a lot of  conversation around fitness body  positivity fat phobia and that's why I  think um we wanted to have this  conversation with both of you together  or uh who doesn't like it ankush I think  it's your quality that has rubbed off on  me hanging out with you and uh I mean  [Laughter]  I don't care exactly is  I mean that's gonna happen anytime  honestly if if I'm being 100 authentic  and if you call me out for being that  then not my problem no it shouldn't be  bothering you know yeah  honestly see if you get called out there  is a sense of uh you know anxiety always  around it  and I was just thinking that I am I'm  coming here with like that mindset that  okay I'm just gonna discuss the things I  you feel personally feel you know and  there are things that definitely I do  not know but I'm willing to learn as  well right and if uh for being that self  I get called out  but if I do then I really cannot you  know manage it is  okay  [Laughter]  it's so difficult to have this  conversation professionally and not  break into insults because that's how  friendships work  um  like it doesn't work for me because  every time trainers are like yeah no do  it one two um  what is this logic of uh you know  trainers being so aggressive in the  train okay so uh not every not every  trainer is aggressive  so uh not every trainer is aggressive uh  you need to understand a person who's  training with you like if it is ankush  it's not gonna work  so I have I have tried uh being very  like uh aggressive also sometimes I I  I've tried being disappointed and then  I've tried actually uh giving him guilt  factor and none of it worked  none of it the the only thing uh which  could move ankush is key uh the next  cheat meal  [Laughter]  so yeah three days ago before you can  eat that three days to go before you  earn that meal and yeah that's what  works and you've also trained uh uh  Karan right yeah no uh didn't I I didn't  train him personally like he was he was  into 37 day challenge uh uh I think uh  Karen uh got injured or something like  that I think a low back  yes agreed  so I think our challenge completely like  in uh the thing is  [Music]  if I if I try to like be a little  aggressive okay on them uh they take it  very very sportingly and they actually  feel it okay there is a coach who's  unlike me no of course like  uh  [Laughter]  thank you I just want to say thank you  there is  [Laughter]  [Music]  Jim and I've failed because I wouldn't  go after the third fourth day because  that's what I think worked with planet  is very smart technique  I know I can't do it I can do it and  then he started you know like he really  eased me into it he's like  and turn up every day like that's what  president told me even if you don't give  it your best every day just make sure  that you turn up every day and that's  how many habits  but then I always go back to it now  do you think that this is a notion that  there is Fitness and then when you look  at a  you know you will never look at a skinny  person and say that oh this person is  definitely not fit but you will always  look like look at a plus size person and  be like this person is definitely unfit  like do you think it's true that thin is  fat but thin is fit but fat is never fit  no there's only one answer to this which  is fat phobia okay uh because uh it's  not like  people who think uh you know people who  do not uh like fat think it's something  to not have or think it's you know kind  of promoting it or whatever  exactly so like having a problem with  somebody being fat primarily according  to me I think you know I'm not big on  definitions but I can just like tell you  my personal understanding of it and I  hope it's correct okay so I think the  answer is fat phobia to that because  it's not like thin people do not have  problems not like skinny people are you  know perfectly healthy yeah or every uh  person who's overweight or obese has  issues you know uh so I uh battled with  covet last year which was pretty intense  and after that I um when I came out of  it I did realize you know there are a  lot of things I need to do in my life  like in general if I survive but also  with my health  uh but  you know it's not like I haven't met  people who were thin and skinny and did  not get any kind of complications  because a lot of people did so does that  mean uh that if somebody is fat only  they can have problems no and does that  mean if they have if they are fat they  definitely will have problem definitely  not because you know like you said like  workout is personal to everyone uh  health and fitness is also personal to  everyone it's a very subjective matter  okay subjective how subjective in the  sense that you know your body  comprises of a lot of things you know  there are hormones there are glands  there's this that there's that in turn  login  so I mean if you and I for example right  now get our tests done you know full  body checkups there will be some things  wrong and just because I am fat does not  mean that I will only get certain things  wrong all right it's not necessary that  a thin person's cholesterol cannot be  high there are a lot of thin people who  are suffering from a lot of problems  that fat people may or may not be  suffering but those problems will not  bother a third person because they look  thin that's what you're saying yeah so  you know it's it's easier for me to say  as a Layman that um  so it becomes the center of everything  exactly okay you know how like parents  tell you to marry life her problem is  because of your phone or because of that  one friend you have in your distant  Circle  just like that  okay like that  as a fitness trainer and not just as  someone who makes people work out it's  Fitness like fitness trainer does the  word Fitness yeah what do you have to  say to that  uh so to the same question yeah okay so  uh I agree with Karan uh because uh I  like merry bodybu essay  like uh  so I I had good amount of weight on  myself which is unproductive uh so  um  of course because  not just by my uh like friends or family  uh my own dad like used to always uh  tell me like look at look at you how how  you have become so I used to think that  it's non  okay and I would like to admit it is  okay like I have also body shamed it I  would love to like put it in forward  because I didn't have any kind of idea  yeah so  um yeah and then I started understanding  Fitness very well okay then I started  understanding key that's because you had  an interest in Fitness yeah because you  just wanted to lose the weight so the so  the thing is key I really wanted to lose  the weight first that's why I joined gym  and primarily everyone's joined uh Jim  because they really want to look good  primarily  yeah so uh um yeah so 10 standard I was  like 95 kgs with five three height which  was like very much and then um  at least I should have some kind of  relevance or like people should notice  me or something like that so I started  working out but the moment I got enough  knowledgeable like when I got certified  as a personal trainer then I started  training people then I actually met so  many people now on like almost there are  like 7000 people who have got properly  uh like uh fit because of uh our  trainings our services right so that is  where we have I I started understanding  the perfect meaning of fat phobia and  then what exactly happens everything and  then I started like recollecting my  childhood memories oh so I used to feel  bad but I used to think like oh it's not  like this is how someone who's plus size  should feel yeah yeah exactly and it is  always bad so somebody is here thank you  literally  yeah so uh when I actually I I met with  a like a small injury like accidentally  uh in before Kobe just  foreign  [Laughter]  so that is where I got to know many  things and then I started thinking about  it  the whole conversation revolves around  Aesthetics in every way exactly we all  know how what men should look like so  agar for example to fit her the first  thing people will tell you shoulders  and the first thing that people will  tell you is some unsolicited advice on  how you should lose weight or how you  should dress up you know this is not for  uh plus size people yeah you know why  because they don't want you to look nice  according to them they just want you to  cover up  you know that's the underline of it  that's under undertone of it that  sometimes you fail to understand  yeah can you not wear shorts sometimes  it's nice but like  or like uh you know why do you have to  open your button so much because like I  have to I have to absolutely  every time you're in a room yes if  you're very fit then also the  conversation they won't see you beyond  your Fitness yeah and if you're so many  times it has happened no the time I was  training you if you remember I used to  only uh uh like uh  it changed the way  he was uh healing from an injury so he  was not working out so he's put on he  put on weight yeah so he would dress up  differently okay right  [Music]  so it is all about uh like uh how you  guys are in love with it but I think  this is this is the name Fitness talks  then where is your Fitness where is your  Fitness talking okay like we need your  photos like do you even have abs bro  maybe because they wanted to check your  credibility Maybe  but then again it's coming from a wrong  notion of Fitness right the pages  Fitness talks with Brandon or AB talks  with brunette okay  then again also I'm going to get some  kind of comment on yes  that is the psychology and the second is  science okay  but yeah let's uh let's agree to that  not fully equipped to discuss that but  yeah but see now because of this podcast  only I'm sure  um  they're very dumb there's a stereotype  right do you do you want to address that  like a lot of people think have you ever  felt that I'm dumb no no so that's the  answer  where it comes from I I cannot tell you  whether they are or not never been with  them but I'll I can tell you where it  comes from you know the notion has  become that these uh boys in gym or like  the ones who are into fitness a lot have  this you know preachy Vibe wants you  like you know lose like it now wait and  gain muscle mass and these are your  goals you got it then then it becomes  like a peach  you know those kind of a certain people  have like uh they're so passionate about  it yeah they've paved the way for the  entire uh you know uh set of people who  go to gym to be uh viewed in a light  like that  if they're they're spending like two  hours in the gym they're in like you  know a fat character's personality is  all about similarly another stereotype  here Jim boys personality is all about  Fitness  the only difference is that this is more  systemic and that's yeah is perceived as  beautiful and that's perceived as uh  dangerous yeah  basic qualifications  [Laughter]  and I've realized that the more con the  more Fitness related content creators  that I've made it to the internet they  have changed the slight notion that  Fitness people don't know much but now  that we have so many creators  they also educate you about so many  things they talk about technicality this  Fitness industry  because of kovid because of uh  you can say that there was a proper boom  of actually becoming a good known  personality on social media trainers  I'll be your creator or something like  that  or you can address people yeah exactly  okay when I got uh the the got to know  that okay I need a platform to Showcase  my talent that is where uh I started  thinking about it so uh  qualifications  okay but uh if you're if you try and ask  that particular person into that  particular field  and you through them you can send so  much amount of knowledge like I have  like  I have done personal person training  course first basic course then I've done  on the nutrition courseport nutritionist  course then I have done the special  population course which is like a course  where you have you get to know how to  treat people with injuries okay then I  had to go through a gym management  course so management is also a biggest  thing okay and then I became the master  trainer  education which people don't understand  exactly so now we'll go to the next  segment which is  one question which is uh three things  you don't understand about the fitness  the scene right now  I think that's what we had a discussion  about is basically like to conclude into  Circle back like yeah to conclude the  episode three things you don't  understand about the whole Fitness  industry and  the fitness as you see it on social  media  um unrealistic time goals  um  [Music]  generalized Fitness plans for everyone  um  and uh  are you measuring your voice no I'm just  like I'm actually not able to think of a  third one but let me because I have a  lot to say  what I don't about the fitness scene  right now third third thing will be  um you know the the I mean that's that's  just like a byproduct but you know the  the toxic ideology that you have to do  this to be fit you know uh like we  discussed the entire episode third point  is it being centered around the  Aesthetics primarily as well I don't  understand okay I agree with the third  Point first okay because that's the  first thing uh like the same questions  questions to me yeah can you repeat the  question again so three things you don't  understand about the fitness industry  yeah  I I understand everything the problem is  uh I'm confused to like how to uh simply  uh let's say explain it to people  explain or like make awareness about uh  it very well okay so maybe that's why  I'm uh being very much active on social  media and trying to create such content  where smartly by humorous side of it by  just putting little bit uh small tips  through uh generalizing it very well  so yeah I'm confused about it  Indian Fitness Industries  [Music]  so that is a big thing actually  difficulty  finally everybody wants key in  anything else that you don't get about  the fitness industry  needs his third point  so Fitness types  under the name of Fitness does that  exact thing comes into the fitness or  not okay okay or is it just covering the  one aspect of it okay that is the like  like I it will be like my humble request  to like everyone who is trying to just  feel humble uh make uh one point clear  only this is the only way of doing it or  like this is the the type of Fitness  that we follow is the perfect way okay  but anyway I'm gonna come to the last  question of this podcast which is uh if  you were to define the modern gentleman  in one word what would it be  himself  oh that's actually pretty cool of course  it is  what about you  wow  for for me to be a gentleman uh I have  to be uh let's say very much expressive  expressive okay so so himself you think  a modern gentleman is himself yeah which  is perfect of course  and you think that modern gentleman is  expressive which is very important I do  I do feel like  episodes  men find it very hard to be vulnerable  and you know Express their emotions so  yeah I absolutely agree with both of  them and also I'm the host of the show I  can't disagree with people who come on  anyway but thank you so much both of you  uh this conversation was very insightful  very very scientific  thanks  and did you guys enjoy it  if that makes sense I would definitely  want to hear it no problem all right  thank you uh for this unnecessary Oscar  speech  but uh do you guys want to sing the Shin  Chan yes yes please please let's do that  guys I was kidding  okay  anyways  what do you think about it okay give it  him shot anyway  guys  [Music]  all right all right this is the end of  the podcast thank you so much for coming  here thank you guys this is your host of  the gentleman show by the man company  signing off please I'm local social  media feedback

complain they reject us  [Music]  some friends on us because we are nice  how fragile masculinity is a lot of  times  means your father  male pleasure as per the patriarchal  society we are living in but that is not  right  hello everyone we're back with another  episode of the gentleman show by the man  company this is ankush bahugana your  host and uh yeah basically listeners  for a shoot and uh  so now it's still a very new feeling so  I was traveling to Bombay for shoot and  um I realized  my hair is looking too shabby idea why  not have an episode on personal personal  care on the go for people who are  constantly traveling how do they take  care of themselves which includes skin  care grooming everything and today's  guests uh that we have  a stand-up comics  so please welcome saurabhan oh thank you  thank you so much thank you everybody  thank you for that wonderful Applause  I like how you started with saying he uh  I was trying to figure out  and I have uh don't have that problem uh  actually I do have another problem  because it's a great problem to not have  problems  you have no issues  and then you have to trim them because  then they look like little mushrooms  growing on your head you have real  struggles yeah oh my god listen you know  there are a lot of people struggling in  this world but I have the biggest  struggle  um which is to try and cut my hair so  every time I'm traveling in a weekend  Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday so I  have to shave my head before my flight  on Thursday  and this is the the weirdest thing so my  wife tells me you have left hair in the  sink I'm like thanks  I appreciate that I have left some hair  somewhere okay so so sort of um  [Laughter]  dude  so now now people have understood a  little bit more uh and also the other  thing is that with comedians right so  they think that there's only one kind of  comedian that exists in the world which  is which is that uh so you say comedy  you're like government  I know better yeah  but how do you explain what you do to  like some relative or some elderly  person uh  [Music]  there's a dude like six foot five tall  good looking guy and all that [ __ ] and  you see these kind of people and like I  already hate this person right exactly I  know  foreign  and I still don't know who he is  he's a very humble guy  but how was last evening you had a show  in Delhi yeah and last evening was fun  yeah so most of my shows are are fun  nowadays because I have changed my  context about what's your count  yeah then like which show number what uh  I don't know but I must be close to  somewhere  2400 cash for something like that must  be I don't know something like that so  at what number did you stop counting I  don't know I like you never counted no  no no I have no idea okay I haven't  absolutely  um  like you do four open mics in a day so  each of those counts as a show so after  a point you're like this is impossible  um  and now you are like dude  you just don't know what the count is  um but Delhi shows are always very  interesting man I had a really good time  yesterday audience  foreign  but now you just have fans who are  coming who've seen your content yeah all  that kind of stuff so yeah but then do  you not feel you missed that first  reaction because they already know you  yeah so they've already if they're  coming to your show they already like  you the first barrier break but do you  miss that feeling of performing in front  of like absolutely new people who don't  know who you are oh dude it's great so  uh and the thing the way you do that is  and so again we are all so full of  ourselves right like you have a lot like  no no like like you  yourself with 900 000 Instagram  followers see I followed you someone's  keeping it down yeah it's a measuring  contest  so uh one of the things I do is that uh  and you're so full of your own world but  Open Mic my audience like I mean Open  Mic my audience is people who understand  stand-up comedy right so they would know  you but they understand some kinds of  Comedy right like who's like say a fan  of like Kenny somebody will come who's a  fan of munawar so because  so they are just there for comedy  tickets and all that kind of stuff so  that's an interesting audience and the  other thing is that uh you open for  other comedians it's a damn  we were doing a show together at this  place  so she opened for me and I opened for  her and it's great because we both are  the only the only context in which this  won't sound wrong yeah  10 months she did and then I did  whatever one and then reversed for her  and I was damn good dude because both of  us ate [ __ ]  because she is  great so it's okay and that's what I  like I love about all you know that that  performance anxiety yeah  so you can experiment a little bit so  you're like I'll try new jokes and all  that [ __ ] and you try new jokes in the  audience you're like okay cool I'll try  a joke that I've done 135 times  like [ __ ] am I just am I just bad okay  see I like how you said bad and I use  the bad word  how awkward is it when people don't  laugh at your jokes it depends on why  they're not laughing how do you know why  they're not like you know like if  they're not laughing because they don't  like like you as a person then you're  like great  but why will if someone's coming to your  show obviously they won't have Vendetta  against you no no the people who buy  tickets for a show are different right  but then if you're doing like a  corporate show oh yeah they have no  choice they have no choice and they're  like stuck in this room and so like  corporate shows that I really love doing  corporate shows and like the recently  they've improved a lot because when I  started ages  context  you bring them in I'm like I can't  compete with the Royal Stags  like I can't go like  that's not an option right but now  people are like the copper shoes are a  lot more fun and also what makes it very  exciting is  the rest of the people have no clue and  that's damn exciting and so I'm like oh  this is fun because some people  acquiring new audience you're acquiring  and also you're trying to convince  people people like the the key is I've  realized that you have to make them like  you in the first two minutes  in whatever way you have to make them  laugh and like you in the first two  minutes or at least if not like you have  to make them laugh I have failed because  the first two minutes I spent I was so  stressed it was like yeah  you told me no no you were preparing and  all yeah yeah you're preparing like you  were Googling who I was no  and then I would be like yes it's me  Kenny Sebastian and so the joke was like  because I look nothing like any  Sebastian yeah and then his fans were  like dude you're not okay enough  what is the worst thing that has  happened to you during a show  I do a whole show about it I'll do a  show called worship ever which is about  some of the worst shows I've ever done  like there was a show I was doing in  gurgaon so um why do all the bad stories  have to start to tell you so okay listen  I'm not I'm not like stereotyping cities  okay no but so okay some stuff has  happened in Bangalore also okay okay but  and I'm not making this up okay every  time it happened in Bangalore it was  Delhi it's impact not making it up  that's a guy who was doing some comedy  in some shows  I'm like dude what are you doing  and I love Delhi it's a great City very  nice people  foreign  and I have a very simple rule which is  that uh and I tell the crowd so people  are heckling me people like buy stations  unfortunately and you'll find out slowly  in the story that the bouncer were  necessary in the story  so uh I I get on stage 10 minutes  so this guy comes on stage  he starts throwing money at me  okay like because  and I am very Shameless I picked it up  and put it in my pocket and I said  and I literally said  like if you want to like throw money  throw Mark actually exactly  and then they kept service going on and  my manager told the manager of the hood  of the restaurant please services  and I was like why didn't you tell me  this I would have used it on stage  all anything is no no my manager was  killed but that's not the point he's  under the stage still yeah he's still  there he's waiting for somebody to call  let's hope  this is uh this is prior to  demonetization so he actually made a  profit  still uh sort of tell me one thing how  much do you travel what's your like day  to day life like you're always on the go  right but you  you must be traveling a lot no to Bombay  whenever I have work but my work doesn't  necessarily involve me to travel all the  time  so but for you like you have to travel a  lot right yeah yeah so tell us what is  your like day to day life like how often  do you travel in a week but  um it can be whatever you want it to be  we're at that point in the show  uh no I'm I'm on the road like four  times a week at least and uh yeah and  again I have kids so uh I've started  actually trying to travel with my kids  and my wife also comes along and uh I  mean the  soft but not qualified that you can't go  back oh listen I love my wife here we  are in a very nice place uh so I like to  travel with them and so four times a  week though I'm out only so I have like  full like you're talking about personal  care I make sure now that any hotel I'm  staying in has a gym  because uh like my plan is to like  become the Dwayne Johnson of Indian  Comedy right that's nothing less than  that so I like wake up in the morning  it's not like uh four kilos of whey  protein every morning um that's my  schedule so I make sure that I have a  gym here because I realize that you're  on stage for whatever one two hours a  day and Baki time pay you have to look  at yourself and also I had I had an  epiphany about this uh recently where as  a comedian or as an artist right  whatever whether you're a musician or an  actor or or whatever it is your your job  is that you get on stage  and you entertain people and that's the  one moment where you're in the moment  and you're getting this attention and  this love from people and if that ever  Fades away you reach a point where  you're like my life has peaked and now  everything is [ __ ] after that I delete  it  you do yeah but your life you  you are fine right yeah  hey don't abuse it's a clean show  I I  what are the good parts about being on  the move like when you travel you see so  many hotels you go to so many cities  what are the good parts of this you you  always meet somebody telling you  something interesting right like uh um  [Laughter]  and always you you overhear a weird [ __ ]  dude like uh like I'll be on a flight  right and one of my favorite things to  do is pretend I have my headphones on  and then you're just overhearing people  talk nonsense  I was on an international flight and uh  there was a couple behind me okay and  they were like it was night and they had  a Kamal which they were sharing so  obviously things are happening and the  guy is just like hey  [Music]  elbow chat now and I'm like what are you  what is happening dude what's this weird  King kid elbow  literally I I was like dude I gotta  listen  what also people tell you interesting  stories man like once you can complete  that story I don't know that's the end  of it and then they were just like  that's the weird like King he's like  I've never heard anybody say hey  elbow chat good night what are you doing  dude maybe they're code words oh maybe  they were code words for what but  if he came up with this code word  it could be actually elbows only then  yeah I mean or maybe a elbow could be  the code word for whatever his thing is  I had a lady once uh tell me a story  about how she got divorced also on a  flight where she said I was in Hong Kong  and my uh um I was getting into uh about  to give birth you were about to give up  no Amazon I mean not yet I have not  figured it out  [Laughter]  maybe maybe they have a strip  so there's a lady who told me she's like  uh dude I'm about to get into a child  but I'm about I'm I'm in labor and I  tell my husband who's in Chennai or  whatever that you need to come to Hong  Kong right now he tells her are we  flight boss  [Laughter]  he's like dude the baby's coming right  now this is not like ankush's flight  which can wait  culture and history and all that kind of  stuff so I I really enjoyed talking to  people about all this kind of culture  and history yeah elbow chat and divorce  because of expensive flights this  question is personal care what do these  two words mean to you it means taking  care of your person  no I do it the only person care I do  again I'm telling you like like working  out eating right and uh just like so one  of my big rules as a professional  athlete that I am is uh that to win  general elections in to win general  elections and also like um I have  decided to make a health-based decision  which is that I'll only have six drinks  in a day right like and I think that  everybody should do is I think you can  add two more to that you know what I'm  so glad you mentioned it because I have  not had less than eight in the last  three days  somebody yeah it's personal care is like  I think it's about about like um I carry  lotion everywhere then that's basically  it that's uh also personal okay yes sure  and I carry a toothbrush uh it's happy  to inform everybody that I brush my  teeth regularly almost uh twice a week  uh so yeah but it's about I think it's  also about uh making things comfortable  for yourself and all because I'm  generally traveling a lot so uh yeah  personal care doesn't only mean grooming  skin care like you said Fitness yeah  it's it's personal care dude I went to  the gym yesterday and like you know  sometimes when you're alone in the gym  and you click selfies yeah you click  selfies and then I record random videos  in the gym so I recorded a video where  about [ __ ] that I can't do in a gym  right so I was like making all weird  sounds and blah blah blah and doing all  weird actions with this recording an  Instagram read which is on my thing and  I'm doing all this [ __ ] thinking I'm  alone in the gym then I realized this is  easy little camera there and I step  outside on the security guy line it just  gives me a look like something  but yeah that's I think Personal Care is  also about just taking care of your  person like I have a very little uh  looks to maintain so yeah but tell us  more about like what it takes to groom  your head oh dude it's very complicated  you know people don't understand this  right because okay now this is a problem  okay is that you're shaving your head  right now very few people have uh eyes  behind right like maybe four I know five  yeah so okay five I didn't know it was  the number had gone up by 20 25 sorry  so every time you shave your head  there's always one Mark here somewhere  or the other so you have to find  somebody to say hey  so I'm just walking around it's mostly  your wife now yeah so I mean she doesn't  like looking at me so but she likes to  look at the back of my head because it  means that I'm going away and she's like  thank God but in the hotels and all like  I have done this I I once decided that I  was on a two-week trip and I was like  I'll shave my head and I couldn't see  the back of my head so I'm going to the  reception and saying hey can you see me  at the back and they're like dude sir  leave  dude it's very tough being a being a  bald dude because like you have to you  have to shave every four days when you  start looking weird and uh  uh all the way till the back yeah  [Laughter]  uh also do the biggest problem is like  okay so you shave your head right and  then for a day you your head feels so  goddamn cold so I um  it's damn cold so okay I carry lotion  and I put it on my head  I'm glad you mentioned for people who  must have been wondering  and people are watching like me do this  and they're like what a weird thing to  do but that's that's my strategy uh yeah  otherwise are you into grooming  otherwise like uh beard shaving do you  always I used to clean shaven I used to  do the French beard and all and uh then  I was like I just want nothing on my  face I want nothing I wanna have I used  to have way earrings and I had a French  beard then I tried that uh  um so I've tried all these experiments  just to distract from the fact that you  don't have hair and now I've just  embraced it I'm like yeah  so when I travel like I told you okay  I mean I have hair now yeah yeah so I've  noticed that notice that about it  was that about a lot of people  so I'll tell you this about this hair  thing okay I'm obsessed with people the  question is gone okay no I know what  question we'll ask but I didn't even ask  the question I can see it  I saw the reflection of your phone in  your eyes  uh I I'm obsessed with people's hair  okay so like my closest people's hair  yeah like people who have nice hair I'm  very Amazed by because again you like  what you don't have right so uh my two  of my closest friends one is Anu Menon  who has very curly beautiful hair and  one of my favorite things is just touch  the hair like because I don't have it  and then another friend of mine has the  most Smooth hair I've ever seen you're  not doing that on flights to people no  no I'm not even oh we'll come to that  also we will come to that also okay  so I literally I hang out with my  friends and I'm just like touching the  hair like this and they're like dude  this is and people are watching and  they're like yeah this is very normal  sort of things that he does I'm Amazed  by people's hair  um so I was on a flight and I'm just  sitting there innocently with my a bald  head and somebody starts rubbing my head  like this  was it the elbow chart guy  he's like what is ahead but a giant  elbow  everything can be an elbow if you put  your mind to it it's like a nose can be  a elbow which got injured many other  body but maybe that was the code elbow  was like maybe everybody doesn't have  same sizes  [Laughter]  so uh somebody's rubbing my head I'm  like what I don't know the air hostess  and she's like are you sauropant I was  like yeah yeah she's like I didn't  realize it then like she really had to  touch to realize that  she's like no I wanted to make sure  that's in my head have you met before I  understand what this is  my head fine like I'm okay I don't care  like it feels like sort of birth would  feel like oh dude and people again we  are talking about weird Kings okay one  of the weirdest things we're not talking  about weird Kings but now anyway  we had to talk about personal care but  okay we're talking about weird Kings  I got done with the show and we will  come up with like selfies and they say  funny face banana funny face uh I got  down to the show in Pune and such a  funny face  I have Infinite funny faces that's a 90  of my comedy  um but uh this one uh group of girls  comes and they're like hey can we kiss  you ahead uh like sure live your life  all the things you could kiss  line of five girls kissing my head I'm  like whatever and then there was a guy  with them and he's like can I say I'm  like go for it man like everybody join  the camp and like 11 people were kissing  my head as that's the running joke the  last guy licked my head so literally  coming back to  so I mean you're talking about the  struggles that bald men go through yeah  it's a lot you know I've faced a lot I  should have uh thought this episode  through yeah you should have uh you  should have thought your choice of guest  of this episode  yeah you were talking about your hair so  can I ask you a question about your hair  what is the worst haircut you've got uh  the worst haircut  that I've got was like  they were different lengths from  different places it looked like a pigeon  got its head stuck in like an exhaust  fan nice so it looked like that very  cool yeah yeah I think every haircut  that I've gotten has only disappointed  me there's just something about haircuts  that you never like them  so you obviously don't have that uh you  know but do you do you when you shave do  you shave it shave yourself or do you go  to like salons too no no I shave myself  it's very self-sufficient so you don't  have that uh stress here salons  it's actually very complicated you have  to go and say sir  and they're like oh because head shaving  oh okay that's it  your skin feels weird so doesn't it look  patchy when you just trim it using a  trimmer yeah but nobody is again seeing  the back of my head ah yeah except your  wife yes many positions yes  foreign  Out of Body Experience let's let's talk  about mental health sort of because when  we talk about personal care Fitness  you know appearance grooming everything  me time what about mental health uh how  do you deal with the fact that sometimes  there will be highs there will be lows  I'm sure did it affect your business oh  crazy yeah yeah mad  but there were no shows there's nothing  happening I had to borrow money from my  parents to pay income tax  this is an actual thing that happened  and my parents used to be part of the  income tax so the money came back to  them only as pension interesting very  very interesting uh pyramid scheme this  was  but uh yeah I mean if and again it  affected everybody's business it's not  just uh like you owe me or whatever uh I  started respecting the audience a lot  more  um and but about uh this I've realized  that I want to reach a state of being  just calm and there  but did it affect you like affect your  mental health when that happened oh yeah  I was going through like uh because also  there was a lot of people they were  still abuse from people discovering old  videos and saying that you are this and  you are that and all that kind of [ __ ]  and then those hordes and hordes of  people coming after you so that honestly  gets exhausting because I think the  problem with the internet to an extent  is that people forget uh you see a  handle you don't see a human being and  that tends to be a lot and I'm like I  have which is why like uh nowadays on on  in shows I do a lot I do a lot more  content than I would earlier do on  social media now my Twitter is just  jokes about cricket and um like you know  where to not go yeah just stop because  I'm like and also I've stopped being  attacking people too much yeah I used to  yeah I think all of us have been part of  the Brigade man everybody is a cloud  chaser eventually everybody I've decided  I don't want to be relevant I don't want  to you don't want to be ready I don't  want to be relevant I want to have my  little Clique of people who like what I  do and I try to be as balanced instance  try to be as sensible as I can about  things because I think there is a lack  of of that everybody is constantly just  trying to find like hey this is uh this  is our lane and that's all the only lane  that exists in the world so I've been  trying to uh and I think this is  specifically during the pandemic this  happened is that the level of empathy  has gone up in a lot of people because  uh one of the things I started doing  during the pandemic was I started having  YouTube members and this is about 30 odd  people who we used to talk to each other  quite a lot and became like a lot of  them became very close friends of mine  and everybody was telling me the [ __ ]  that they're going through somebody's  going through restaurant business which  is completely budge out somebody is a  student whatever which is going through  a lot and then you're talking to other  friends of yours who are Comedians and  creators and restaurants and travel  people and then just generally people  who have jobs that involve them going  somewhere and uh so I think we've all  just been through a ringer and if if the  pandemic has not taught you uh how to  sort of be kinder to people then what  are you doing with yourself I feel that  in the pandemic what also happened is  that people  were using internet a lot right which  basically means there was more influx of  people on the internet and that also  meant an influx of opinions right so  when you say that people started  empathizing more yes like in certain you  know periods of time yes but then I also  saw people being a lot more vicious yes  they were just spending more time on the  internet and sometimes what happens is  when you're spending your time on the  internet you're having a bad day it  reflects in what you do on the internet  when you go and you sit on people's  profiles and stuff yeah it shows that  you're having a bad day and you want to  take it out correct on people so yeah  it's been it's been a roller coaster  that way though did you did you get a  lot of online stuff like online abuse  and on oh no for like I mean I have a  makeup page also so  um  which is okay people are allowed to not  find me funny most of my friends don't  find me funny yeah yeah so which is okay  but um  in general why did we get to hate on the  internet we're talking about mental  health but yeah I'm saying that you uh  you said makeup while I mean  not so if you compare the love and the  trolling the love is always more because  that's how you're growing on social  media right but  yeah  what is it what is that I want to know  makeup rules  okay that's another thing only so the  next segment is called where there's a  fun activity that we're doing you have  to tell us as Activity  three secrets that no stand-up comic  will ever tell you  um all of them uh alcoholics all of them  uh all everybody and there's no hashtag  not all stand up comics  no nobody's alcoholic um three

to the  society  what about you know the head of there  [Music]  idea of beauty the society you should  look like this  [Music]  hi everyone this is ankush bhagana you  have tuned in to yet another episode of  the gentleman show by the man company  lives  which brings me to my next topic which  is hustle culture because there is a  hustle going on right here okay and uh  motivational content and everybody is  saying the same things that you know  hustle hard work hard don't give up and  it's I personally find it very  aggressive and um I don't know I just  want to discuss this with someone who  has founded his own brand which is a  coffee brand called rage coffee we have  with us Mr Bharat City hi Bharat I am  thank you for having me Bharat is  sitting here so calm and composed and  he's like confident here  and it's intimidating me because  um  now it's giving me stress  but that's my style I just uh you know  like people to take charge I like them  to lead from the front or your Merry  life may I think uh Sarah magic he has  happened because I've trusted people and  I've let them take charge and do what  they know best so just saying this is  not helping it's only doubling the  pressure on me right now  what is I know that it's subjective  maybe to a certain extent but what does  the word hustle mean and what does it  mean to you specifically  I think can hustle the word uh in  general  means that you are out there uh and  you're you know you're attacking your  goals your you know you know conquering  your day uh and that makes you happy  and that hustle basically it has that  go-getter vibe to it's like like you  said attacking yes it's the choice of  the word that you show it's like that's  why I find it I personally find it a  little aggressive that approach you know  go get it and it's you know may I don't  honestly uh believe in Hustle culture I  believe more in Pasar culture basically  yeah honestly it uh it's not for  everyone I think one of the biggest  things that I've discovered uh is that  music is  right uh I was that's you as a person  that that's me as a person and I've seen  people in my family very close to me  who just don't get it and that is what  get the culture of hustle because it's  not coming from within it's not  something that is in their own yeah  I have not seen that to be a positive  outcome mostly so you think yeah  go-getter attitude this is a very  personal thing and people who have it  have it and people who don't have it  don't have it is that what you're saying  yes  can people learn it  people do learn it uh you know I've seen  that also but I think it's your DNA it's  what you grew up with uh and it is a  part of your inherent personality  um  in the way you you know approach things  yeah yeah that's what I have seen  typically here  and the hustle does not necessarily mean  being successful or  I in my company for example  like to hire foxes and hedgehogs both  okay  different kind of uh meanings and  allergies but overall for me that is  some people stay calm they do one thing  they do that one thing supremely well  and then there are foxes who do 10  things  um and they do all those 10 things on  time you know perfectly good Hustlers  they're Hustlers he's a hustler yeah it  basically means that he he's tackling  more than you know more than a general  person could like he's challenging his  ability like capabilities every day and  yeah he's not stopping yeah absolutely  so so there are all kinds of people here  Matlab Hustler is a word to me it's not  something that uh I feel it's you know  it's breaking or moving the needle for  me  as a person  that person is doing a better job it is  a part of your DNA it's a part of  justice and that might lead you to  success it's such an important thing to  say what you just said because I also  agree that some people are Hustlers by  just the way they're built and some  people are maybe their philosophy is  slightly different their approach to  things is slightly different they're not  as aggressive in their approach they're  not as uh  they may not be as ambitious also  sometimes which is which is okay which  is perfectly fine but yeah motivational  content  you know what I mean yeah mostly mostly  internet internet  because it's not sustainable right if  it's you can attempt it you can attempt  it but if it's not within you um  you know you want to become the best  swimmer in the in the in the city or in  the country then  and you know some people  career that's the biggest aspiration in  life in general some people look at jobs  just like jobs  and I have other aspects to my life that  are equally important to me some people  are like me  I will hustle my way to the top yeah so  when you said  this is what reminded me of that I know  so many of my friends are very ambitious  so many of my friends are doing  and they're happy with that  there's nothing wrong with that right  absolutely not because  either you can listen to who you are  or you can fight it fighting it is not  sustainable it's not helpful in the long  run  success is not coming only to hustlers  foreign  you know all the chemicals in the body  dopamine releases through hustle  some people are calm impactful but calm  the hustle is not there but they are so  amazing at what they do and then their  Hustlers were driving some parts of the  business which these guys could not able  to do Fair don't know  it's at the absolute right uh equal spot  but do you think that this word hustle  has become like a catchphrase on social  media to you know just uh  you know what I mean yeah  I had to stay away I don't know much  yeah you're not like you're not active  on social media uh I try to stay away  why  it's a waste of my time I should not say  this but you said it not editing that  out at all oh God yeah I think uh you  know personally for me personally it is  doesn't you know give me the best uh  value for my time a business runs on  social with me you really are talking  like a hustler it does not give me value  for my time oh my God  please as some women  yeah  you know we've spent countless time I  don't enjoy it right I like to keep my  life private and I like to not be out  there and personally  about six seven ten years back but now I  think uh They're all playing with our  minds and  as a someone whose career depends on  social media I will maintain my silence  on this but uh yeah honestly if I talk  about myself  United has made me very uncomfortable  because I'm an actor writer content  creator and I have Ambitions  this I've talked about in a YouTube  video also about pelecki  um  especially as men  and it's such a competitive world out  there everybody doesn't get to the top  yeah that's not how ranking works if  someone is at the top there will be  people at the bottom also right and  everybody finds their own place  eventually but there is this constant  pressure  give it your best shot and that honestly  scares me I feel that it's it becomes  like a rat race and then sometimes you  stop enjoying what you're actually doing  you forget yeah  and you know  people take careers why because they  want to earn money so as long as that  need is being met it is okay to have  your ambition at like aspiration and  ambition at 50 also it's very personal  some people compromise their comfort  just to get successful they're like for  example  um I'm an actor people keep telling me  to Bombay shift  or opportunities and I'm aware of that  and I'm aware  I may be losing out on opportunities but  I know the kind of person that I am if I  go to Bombay and if I put myself in such  an uncomfortable position  yeah it's not going to motivate me it's  going to demotivate me yeah because me  as a person I thrive in a little bit of  comfort and a lot of ambition yeah but  if that Comfort is snatched away from me  the comfort of being people around  people that matter to me the comfort of  having a personal life comfort of having  friends next to me  I will I will not survive yeah and you  know  and I keep thinking like same advice  that I will not cross I will hustle till  the point but the moment it starts  taking over my life I may step back and  and I've accepted that maybe  you can still wish for the Stars  and still be okay with whatever little  you get because you know efforts correct  correct correct so I've come to this  realization which is why  I strongly feel that you know this  hustle culture this concept has to be  customized for everyone everyone is very  differently built mentally yeah yeah  yeah no I think you're absolutely right  uh I don't know if I made sense but you  made you made yeah I think that's what  we've been talking also right the the  it's very uh you know subjective uh and  you know I'll tell you what happens  it is not to me it is not to prove to  others who I am what I am what I am  capable of  the realization is as an you know when  I'm growing also uh  it is about internalization  how can you prove to yourself your own  Worth and be content and happy with that  that is the whole game inter you know  external validation is a bottomless pit  is that an attack  [Laughter]  seriously that I don't know if it helps  somebody to know that uh seeking  validation it's a good push for people  but you can't depend on it forever yeah  yeah yeah yeah most amazing things in  your life will come from your internal  drive which is also dependent on  talk Channel factors  But ultimately it all settles down on  your own  um  most cases you should be happy or you  should be fine with it that's what I  have learned  which stands the test of time  in supermarkets in New York and Paris  and you know Melbourne  it's my journey I want to do it my way  and that drive comes from a lot of other  factors but mostly it's an internal most  of it is internal are you a competitive  person  here if I say I'm not then I would be  lying a lot  um  we are made to believe every decision  that we take in life is a make or break  situation  and life is so strange that sometimes it  may feel like the best decision at that  point five years later it won't even  matter and sometimes just direction  that will lead up to such a big door so  you also have to understand that life  has its own plans sometimes you know and  it's not one decision is not going to  change your life yes it's an  amalgamation of a lot of other factors  yeah no this is my biggest one of my  biggest learnings in business in life  that  uh there is no end game  there is no end point from cat  destination okay absolutely so so you  because I started a very very young very  early  business  so I think uh  I have made so many mistakes to realize  yeah  um  I hear it sometime and I'm like no if  you're not taking time off then you will  trust and to make perspective on the  things that you're doing and you know  you take decisions and then you need  time off to understand yeah do I really  want this momentary both are and I also  feel that yeah  so many people will be on Crossroads in  life multiple times  should I go for option A should I go for  option b  I just want to sometimes say to them  here it doesn't matter whatever you  choose will lead you somewhere  no matter which path you take life will  take you somewhere yes  but it leads to dorby only yeah yeah  right so every decision is not make or  break just you know just do what you  think makes sense right now yeah  and it should be  your own decision that's another  important factor it should not  be influenced by people I mean it should  be you should hear your folks out you  should hear your family out in fact good  well wishes out but overall yeah  out of uh your own will area because  what decisions  you will maybe not feel very content  with it and that will reflect in the  outcome of that decision  because you're not putting it in the  right way yeah  because they were not cut out for  academics yes yes  if you're not made for something  how do you expect to and yeah personal  opinion is not an advice to people I  just feel that sometimes both advice  but then people talk so much about it  where you no longer know what your heart  wants yeah this is such an important  point you've mentioned because when I  was starting rage at that time  um  but overall I was starting to figure out  here  you are special or your business will be  special  because you have identified something  that others can't or others have not  okay is filling the  gapsco basically then you will get a uh  you know data set of advice that is  actually you know not even true  absolutely that's relevant it's not  relevant actually so  productive it's not productive for you  yeah I mean you will end up not doing  something because you've taken advice  from people who don't get it um  they're not the right jury for this yeah  so to as you mentioned why is  over exposure of your uh you know ideas  or your thoughts sometimes I feel that  it leads to all you know the killing the  joy of doing something you tell me what  was your hustle as an entrepreneur what  were the struggles what was what would  you call your hustle Hassan  again my hustle has been I think  just the drive to  uh  make my own worth count  to myself  when I was 21 I founded a internet  company  I joined a large organization  my mom told me  um actually so my mom my mom asked me  rather  you know  and I was very angry I was very Furious  so she figured it around she was like  they're not uh you know giving me enough  respect and my mom's like TK Matlab  respect in the sense  and I had done throughout my college  life I had done several internships  foreign  just the ability to go out and now it's  changed I want to uh generate you know  Mira Target and then I want to generate  10 000 people's employment in the next  five years uh I need to uh be able to  build a brand that is globally well  known  Indian brand  um  but overall it stems from the same  things that yeah  can you do it can you attempt to do it I  tell myself I'll ask myself  and then if the answer is yes  I said let's try it  something else will happen out of it hmm  so that's all it's so interesting that  hustle means such different things to  people like if I look at my own Journey  my hustle has not been my work my hustle  has been not giving up  my hustle has been every day waking up  and  you know still believing yeah  in the bigger picture these small little  steps small little victories will lead  me somewhere  even though like as an actor  every week you give so many auditions  and then you never hear back yeah or you  get rejected and then you see people  getting ahead and you're like wobbies  am I in the wrong field or or when will  I know that it is time to give up yeah  because you don't know you see the thing  is  so you will always have to live with the  doubt key  what if what if we'll never you will  never get an answer to what if in life  so my hustle has always constantly been  to  still keep at it that has been my hustle  that is also my hustle that you I don't  have only one kind of hustle or the I  think also with everyone I think  that's also true you know and the other  thing is that uh keeping at it  is the fundamental thing  every day you wake up and you are like I  have to go after this again Journeys I  have a 2017-18 when I was trying to  build rage uh you know and start rage  rather  many times I woke up in the morning  and there's a there was a voice in my  head that told me  you know stain hmm and  now you might say that it's easy that  it's behind me so I can say this but  Aqua is just uh maybe 30cs are the loud  loud  get up go run  you're not going to sit home  so I think because because my  discoveries were all with the  manufacturers  many times I was kicked out of their  offices also because  um you know  salaries  and these people were people who  believed in me and then um  who are looking up to you right that  is  disappointment and that is something  mercos  I have to get these Pi they believe in  me I have to go out for them every day I  wanted to bring up this whole idea of  taking breaks and taking time offs is  because  again my personal opinion hustle culture  and whatever you know of it from the  internet  leaves no space for it  and it's I mean it's great that people  want to hustle and all but I just think  that  um  because you are you are your biggest  asset if you lose yourself in the  process then it doesn't matter what you  were chasing because you're not in it  anymore yeah  yet burnout is a real thing it's been  very real it is very real and yeah let's  tell our listeners what the word burnout  means yeah uh you know to me it happened  when I was running my first company  um and and mostly I think I wasn't aware  um in fact I have not digressed much  into it to I just know one thing that  has sold the company because I burnt out  that company had so much potential it  had so much it could do but just because  I actually just lost interest because I  burnt out hmm  you know I was a sports person I was on  the goal always your sports what sports  did you find well I was playing football  I played football you know throughout my  school life college life I mean  something that gives me happiness right  do you still play I play I try to play  yeah oh that's great  available for anybody every day if 12  hours  and then suddenly I think one or two  months I was like I just don't want to  go to office I don't want to do this  anymore I don't want to see those same  faces I I just and to me then I realized  that I burnt out and and that was to go  going back in that space  is you know uh I I think of it and I  actually feel like yeah  because you know this Clockwork life  that had happened  creators  I'm sure all the creators listening to  this if they are uh they would relate to  this key creators in a burnout so happen  very quickly very periodically every  third fourth month where you wake up  with this anxiety here  and you know Rose contentment  questions  but sometimes that entire process  becomes it weighs you down heavy feeling  yeah  so I become extremely unproductive when  I am under pressure  force myself to make content which is  happening by the way right now that  cycle is  I I'm glad I'm shooting this podcast  I'll give it two three days I'll give it  a week foreign  yeah if you're in a job could be  aggressive could be simple nine to five  whatever right  you're answerable to one or two people  you're reporting to your immediate  manager mostly yeah as a business person  as somebody who's doing anything that is  running a team collectively and that  pressure is on you then you have more at  stake than your employees is that  nice  let's talk about the responsibilities  the accountability yeah you are  accountable to your employees your  accountable to your vendors your  accountable to your customers and even  if your employees mess up  it's you who's going to have to of  course fire it's going to trickle down  trickle up to you actually  uh you know that it's um  to me I would not do anything else in  life  right but  you're also answerable to your investors  you're answerable to the you know the if  you are lucky enough to build a large  company you're answerable to people  who've put faith in you in the form of  money  accountability  accountability is  like every profession has its own you  know challenges  when you go on social media and you see  about entrepreneurs and it's become like  a thing you know entrepreneurship  there is so much conversation about it  they always talk about  I'm My Own Boss nobody's my boss I'm My  Own Boss but boss  if you are honest to your job uh as an  entrepreneur as a leader  debunk this myth where people say that  certain professions where people have  flexible hours that basically means  that doesn't mean  sometimes yeah sure like as a content  creator some days I can choose not to  shoot but that's also because some days  I have to shoot  for like 20 30 days without a break and  I'm not saying that my profession is any  more difficult than yours or yours is  any more difficult than someone else's  because that actually brings me to  another topic Bharat does hustle ever  stop  it's for each to his own hustles  if the hustle is not coming from within  and the definition of hustle also  changes right right when I started out  for example I was spending 14 16 hours a  day right in front of the system got a  back problem put on a lot of weight you  know burnt out in four years right  but then they were learnings so I think  uh the it evolves it the definition  should change  and that's about it but for me  personally I think that's the way of  life for me but for somebody who's  borrowing it or thinking of doing it  because  it might not be sustainable that's my  personal view  this is what how I feel  that's a lot of food for thought  actually and I would I think we're  coming to the close of this episode now  uh we're coming close to the end of this  episode what am I saying and uh is  and I've realized that  there is no one thought that will make  sense to everybody on the whole  everybody approaches their careers their  aspirations so differently and hustle  means  so many different things to people yeah  and you have to just decided for  yourself I think and just don't just  don't burn out just  self-preservation is as important as how  successful you are because if you don't  if you're not taking care of your mental  health if you're not understanding who  you are as a person and how far you can  go understand your boundaries understand  how far you can go for success  the journey is going to be difficult  yeah yeah no you've summed it up really  well actually just focus on your own  Journey  and um try to make time for you know  happy things small things and yeah just  try to find some just breathe just  breathe  it's it's not a make or break decision  that you have to take right now and uh  with that we come to our next segment  which is called  word association game you know how I'll  give you a word  you say that the first word that comes  to your mind you can't take time let's  start yeah okay the first word is  entrepreneurship  hustle wow convenient energy  mind  soul  Hustle  you can't say entrepreneurship  quick quick Hustle  um  man company show wow  free time  free time family movies  don't watch Instagram  um business  relaxing travel competition lovely  success  success Joy  okay that's it uh before we let you go  I'm gonna ask you one final question  Define the modern gentleman in one word  confident  confident  okay aware  confident okay so according to Bharat if  there could be one word that could you  know Define the modern gentleman it  would be confident confident in their  Journey confident with their hustle as  we like to call it  um thank you so much this was a very  insightful conversation I I have so much  food for thought after this like I'm  gonna go back home and think about so  many things that you've put so simply  easily thank you so much I hope you had  a good time on this podcast thank you so  much I

the  society  what about you know the head of there  [Music]  idea of beauty the society you should  look like this  [Music]  is  I mean who can do without best friends  there can you imagine life without them  I I can't  foreign  two very good friends and stand-up  comedians as much as uh Nirmal would  like to disagree we have Nirmal and  Abhishek coming in all the way from  Chennai hi ankush thank you so much for  having us and uh thank you we feel very  special we've been flown from Chennai to  Delhi hello podcast and to get to chill  with you on the couch yeah and they've  given us water water these earphones  which are very special one second it  will tell me what was your problem with  me calling you stand up comedians yeah I  wanted to know what stand-up comedian  yeah I it's just because I'm very new in  stand-up comedy so I was doing content  so it's just been like two months or  something thing so it feels wrong to  just say that stand to claim that to  claim that I am standard because you  realize it'll be very weird for him to  introduce comedian animal and stand up  comedian yeah yeah yeah I know so yeah  that's not a comedian stand up comedian  you're okay with that okay cool so I  mean tell me what's up guys uh what's  your absolute first reaction sitting  here  I I don't know podcast is such a big  deal number one yeah at least in India  abroad being blown up Spotify giving you  Million Dollar Deals and all yeah but  it's great you mine hasn't come yet but  manifested you make it seem very cool  man it is it's fun no the first time I'm  saying makeup for podcast you know there  is a makeup and there's a cute or a  podcast yeah exactly so it feels great  it it feels like okay we should we  should put in some effort I feel like  I'm less prepared for this less prepared  yeah during a stand-up comedian like you  that you know the expectations are a  little like uh higher yeah even I'm a  comedian I think I'm not a stand-up  comedian but wow he's  back what do you think yeah I mean now  now that you said that there's pressure  to think of jokes but uh no that's  absolutely okay no pressure on you guys  let's start with uh how did you both  become friends how do you know each  other  this this fellow will tell one story no  not like the story is false  so I used to judge fests I used to judge  theater Fest I was and this guy I  thought just as a as just judge people  and also but uh I got paid for judging a  theater Fest in IIT Madras they have  this Fest called Sarang Nirmal was in  nit and he came there to participate to  participate participate he was two years  three years for context this guy at that  time was a 5000 follower guy like mini  celebrity again and then every time  every time when I'm saying the story he  interrupts to put this context which  does not it helps it helps for what  reason it helps to make you awkward I'm  guessing exactly I don't know there's no  emphasis on that but okay so I finished  there's a small break of 10 minutes he  comes out of nowhere he's like bro I  have this rap I want to perform this rap  for you I'm like okay what is the  Rapport it's a Dosa wrap it's about Dosa  okay and then he starts rapping and then  normal you will continue what happened  that's it so basically what happened is  I knew he was some popular gay or  something I don't know how to approach  people I just decided I'm gonna do yeah  you clear  it's been three years now I don't know  one line of what he wrapped okay it was  very very clear now so even he does it  yeah yeah so and he stops after a point  he realized no one's able to understand  he's like that's it bro and he leaves  okay okay so it was a great icebreaking  session I had with this young energetic  kid basically I wanted to hear like what  do I do with this with the rap yeah I'm  sorry I didn't you told me you told me  you told me I'm making into a video yeah  then I'll understand he'll have lyrics  [Laughter]  when he says thank you he doesn't sound  very thankful at least then I'll  understand that's that's what I meant by  thank you but you should you should it's  it's very funny was it one of those  situations where someone comes in  they're having a conversation you can't  hear anything's like oh yeah yeah yeah  yes no but his conviction was so good  like he according to him that was the  best rap ever he was he was Kendrick  Lamar for those two and a half minutes  so it felt great I was admiring his  confidence and conviction but not the  context of it and then this is how you  guys met but how did you become friends  huh that in during the lockdown I what  two three of his videos surfaced and I  realized he's very funny and I  remembered I connected the dots telling  what is the same those are up guys and  like there's something distinctly funny  about him he's not usual funny different  funny and I wanted to work with him so I  hit him up telling do you want to make  videos together and you were already  making videos he was already he already  blew up with this character called Mrs  janaki that he did yeah one one  character I did it blew up during locked  on so I have this thing like it's weird  asking someone bigger than you to  collaborate you know they'll feel like  you're leaching on there yeah but it's  always nice if you ask someone lower  you're not obligated to right right you  won't feel guilty yeah so I I really  like this work it was very distinctly  funny so I asked him if he can if you  want to collaborate and we started  making videos and that's how you became  friends yeah yeah uh show me your  t-shirt it's the same t-shirt same  t-shirt same t-shirt yeah it's h m wow  yeah oh we can't say h m it's the man  companies from the Wardrobe Department  of man company it's a shout out to  wardrobe Department that's so cool yeah  yeah wow it reminds me of that Meme  that's floating on the internet that if  two women you know see each other  wearing the same dress they get like oh  [ __ ] in the same dress and when two men  they're like they bond they bond over it  it's it's smart that you got a jacket on  top yeah yeah  it looks good on you please  hold me if you take it off I think yeah  you do look like me from the future I  think if you take it off what's that  just future me ah okay future me  never met let's move on I say stupid now  I feel what you felt that day  like like your time time traveled and  you were 10 years yeah yeah yeah and I'm  stuck between both of you and yeah oh  God okay I should have stopped  explaining it yeah so how growing up how  are your male friendships like  do you still have uh those uh amazing  for me friends itself I think you can  have a very few tight extremely tight  friends types so I did have one of my  friend my best friend till to date is we  were in the same lkg section we were  throughout school we were in the same  section in college we studied the same  course we did the same job until like I  quit like a few uh sometime back so yeah  he's still my best friend types in  college also I met some three four other  guys were extremely tight friends with  me school I've lost everybody else  except that one dude so um Abhishek do  you are you are you someone who really  values friendships in life oh yeah at  some point I I think after during my  first relationship I got really  distracted by falling into the  relationship love and all that so you  lost friends I didn't lose friends I I  wasn't as tight with my best friends  when I was in that honeymoon phase of  the relationship but that always happens  I I realized that I should it shouldn't  have happened that way because my  friends got really pissed about the fact  that I didn't spend as much time and  they didn't like the person you were  dating let me know they they did like  her but then it wasn't the same you know  whenever I went I had so much to catch  up yeah it didn't feel right right later  relationships felt so good because I  balanced time well if I had gone on a  date I'll make sure I meet my friends  after that you know I made sure they  were always in the loop of things yeah I  you know there's this uh thing that I've  realized over time that your  relationships everything is  like nothing beats friendships in life  yeah nothing yeah because you know your  your girlfriends your boyfriends  everything they'll come and go but who's  gonna stay your friend exactly it's a  constant right and you know it's the  only relationship which is not which  happens the most organically absolutely  like especially dating and all you seek  dates yeah absolutely people absolutely  fall in love with and whatever  um Family you don't have a choice yeah  friends are the only people you know you  just come together and it just clicks  and it happens and there are no expect  like there is the right amount of  distance they don't demand too much yeah  but you still fulfill each other's you  know you make each other's lives more  wholesome to think about it I I don't  remember the first time I met my best  friends you know it was so organic it's  like a dream I don't know where the  dream started you know yeah but it's  going great so that's very true of it  it's so organic that you don't know how  it started yeah but it's the best yeah I  mean I want my listeners to also think  about this key when you think of your  best friends do you remember the first  day you met probably not you have great  memories but no yeah time passes and you  don't realize how important this one  person becomes for you exactly exactly  oh my God yeah that's so true that's so  true yeah and it's you know in case of  men especially because you know we all  grow up uh thinking that it's not okay  for us to express cry whatever it's only  with their friends where their safe  space lies oh yeah I think even if  they've done something wrong  which is also slightly problematic that  your friends will always hype you up no  matter what [ __ ] you've done uh but I  think in case of men their safe space is  always their friends yes never their  family it's never their Partners it's  somehow always their friends know yeah  so true so true recently recently we had  a show in Dubai yeah it was my first  ever international trip oh wow I have  two of my best friends in school once in  San Francisco one is in Auckland they  both flew to Dubai for the show that's  only friends can do that man I still  don't know why they did that I I would  have not done it even if it was as rich  as them both yeah but they came they  didn't come for the show they stayed  with us two days yeah they booked the  same hotel we were staying in and you  guys chilled we chilled it we haven't  chilled like that in ages I haven't met  these guys because the code happened and  all that it's been three years since I  saw their faces we had a trip in Dubai  but I think only yeah best friends can  do [ __ ] like that somehow these two  because they're best friends with them  or something and he's friends with me  they just accepted me fully yeah yeah no  nothing it was so adopted to be able to  adopted it's great to be adopted by rich  people man and they're clearly Rich if  they flew to Dubai yeah they're not  revealing a lot of financial details to  me but yeah I'm happy for them do you  all do you sometimes find yourself  seeking validation from your friends  like for example my friends are I  wouldn't say that they love what I do  because I mean they don't think that I'm  that funny and I've I've made them at a  point where you know  I mean I was a different I used to be a  very different person back then when I  was in this conference and whatever so  know me from then so now the Nokia I  mean we're very happy for whatever  you're doing but we know you from the  college like you're at the college for  me yeah yeah and initially in my journey  I used to get like a little myth that  you know why are you not supportive and  it's not like they're not supportive  they're just not my audience you know  yeah they don't particularly find me  funny they're like uh what's the big  deal yeah you're funnier in real life  like no matter how funny I am in my  videos they'd be like yeah but you're  funnier when you're not trying you know  when you're just talking then you're  funnier what are you doing this have  realized very early on like in initially  when I just started making videos and  stuff the first two videos or something  all my friends shared and stuff like  that soon they stopped and I was that  time I was curious I was like why is  nobody supporting but then I realized  that they are not obligated to yeah it's  not their thing to and that's when I  realized okay and my goal is to not make  my friends keep sharing my stuff all the  time it's to make General audience yeah  and feel that and and that's where it  becomes special yeah at some point they  share some video yeah you know that  video you know that's extremely funny  I'm a massive validation yeah so that  always happens because I don't share any  of my work on my friends groups and all  that so at some point if it surfaces on  my friend's group telling this is funny  that means that video is done really  well yeah yeah so so my so my guy best  friend uh who's always told me on my  face that uh you're trying too hard  you're not really funny like I mean he  didn't say you're not funny he said  you're funny in real life but when  you're making content I know you as a  person so I know when you try when  you're trying to crack a joke you know  people inside out right when you're best  friends with them so recently I did a  short film and he specially message me  saying dude what a performance I know  that it was you but it didn't still  didn't feel like you and I've seen you  act in it always I always am aware that  oh he's trying to act but this time you  didn't and that meant so much to me that  meant way more than all the other  compliments that I got but what happens  what is the dynamic between you two then  because like you said you can disconnect  with your friends but with you you can't  we can't yeah you connect further but  but then we discuss about things of  content creation of Comedy as you do we  discuss about as much it happened  gradually yeah because first few times  when you're just making videos that's  all on your mind that's the only  commenting you know as soon as you spend  more time we know other common factors  common it's about realizing that it's a  safe space yeah to talk about anything  so we gain trust over yeah this one and  a half years that we can talk about  anything right you can talk about this  yeah like for example this podcast going  before this right we were texting each  other about how it's going and how we  have to prepare yeah and then he's like  my pet is not good so the tangents to  our conversation are amazing slips uh he  slips out all your emotions so easily I  look at him being clueless  there must be something do nothing like  he doesn't even fart I don't know it's  very silent see again the fart is also  Incognito if I fart I'm just like that  nobody if you need to hear that we did  not need that is  ladies and gentlemen this is why now now  when you watch movies  um and how movies represent best friends  and all do you think that's true  some movies some movies even we watched  together and we're like to do this  yeah friends don't make plans that  easily first of all but friends don't  have so much money yeah but it's  aspirational we're like we should go  have you seen this but there's something  about movies on friendships that you  will watch them no matter how bad there  are some friendship movies that are not  great but you want to find a Vibe just  the fact that they're about friends and  you watch them and you're like I want to  experience everything that I've read in  books but one of the last Friends movie  watching you're like I related to it  yeah I mean it was not a male friendship  movie but last I finished that show  called The Bold type oh yeah it's about  three women and they're they're friends  so I love watching shows and movies  where it's about friendship and  friendship takes precedence over  everything else yeah because that's how  I see my life I'm like very true very  true yeah yeah same the only thing I  whine a lot I crib a lot about  everything in life the one thing I  always say that I lucked out on is  friends  it's the one and sometimes when I'm  feeling really low I remind myself that  listen like I've  for the longest time I've had such good  friends who've stuck around and nothing  has gone wrong and that is there is so  much to be grateful for like in there  yeah but then when I see these movies  where they're making these Euro trip  plans and I go back to my group where  half the people haven't responded  someone saying Q I have a heaven at home  so I can't go to Europe and someone has  already gone in the meanwhile someone  has already made a plan and gone yeah  without us my friends are binary they  either come to Dubai or you don't meet  them for three years so I relate to it  to to meet them in Chennai because  they're right now in Chennai I haven't  met them it's been three four weeks so  it's very tough to put plans together  and also the whole idea that friends  will give you the best advice no they  don't no no become the worst advice they  give impulsive advices just to end the  conversation right there like oh yeah  yeah eat orange it's good for your skin  I'm like okay thanks how's that going to  help me get the girl back eating an  orange exactly how do I get to Auckland  with orange on my face but uh what are  the worst advices that like friends have  given you worst advices yeah  mine was stand up to people in your  office  oh yes and why what happened there I  mean in general you know like if you  feel that someone's not giving you your  Duo whatever stand up to people in your  office and all that  and it's so filled me to say all of  these things  but then you know it makes things  awkward yeah like that and turns out was  my fault so I don't think my friends  have given me best advices they just  know I'm  easily uh tauntable you know they taunt  me so much they make me really this is  also a trait now is it a word I just  made it up I just made it up but I'm  sure a lot of people relate yeah so very  easy to taunt you basically yeah very  easy to taunt me like for example  there's once we hit a basketball outside  our school premise okay it fell into a  neighbor's house this cash flow just  jump get the ball and come I jumped I  got the ball no one was there around me  except my Peterson was a huge stick he  whacked the [ __ ] out of me I had to see  my friends last I met them was in Dubai  after that so it was they just  disappeared very  in stealth mode what about you worst  advice I don't think anybody's given me  worst advice because usually what  happens is we have if I have a problem  or somebody else has a problem we sit  together and we try to figure out what  are we gonna do for this it's like that  it's like a break group project yes it  becomes a group project at the end okay  this sounds like a movie you know yeah I  have a problem then the next team  they're all together but in reality  yeah okay yours is little scripted the  life  definitely scripted in in North India  this is like a recurring joke between  friends key you know there's a line  called  it's it basically means that uh a lot of  people in North India get drunk and they  have this urge to drive  [Laughter]  okay so  it's a sentiment so if you Bhai  basically mean meaning like my best  friend right so no matter how drunk the  guy is he will tell his best friend  it's a sentiment is there anything like  that um  with you guys like a sentiment yeah  I I think we we work on this motor even  yesterday we're talking is there like a  line that you that people in South  industry a lot  okay we related to it  it's basically means  basically but us specifically what we  like doing is when we're on this tour we  realized every time we're in a new city  both of us are equally excited we are  impulsive Max that every after every  show that night we go Sleepless we  explore the city we do all the cliche  stuff and we want to do like we'll drag  some people whoever is there our friends  who are there in the particular City  yeah this is such a good topic to  discuss man like you can be best friends  with people but they could be horrible  travel companions yeah yeah I think  that's where we locked down because  we're equally curious as to what the new  city maybe that's how you bonded man  yeah maybe maybe yeah because you like  traveling so much and I don't know  there's something about trips that  everything is just two times more  philosophical oh yeah everything in life  makes sense and everything is  aspirational you feel less guilty  wasting time in another city yeah than  your city yeah that's what I feel yeah  yeah okay in my city if I were doing a  night out the entire night I'm like I'm  wasting so much time I should have been  home foreign  but in Delhi I feel like I'm holidaying  yeah how does matter how productive I am  yeah basically I'm not holidaying I'm  here for work but still I can but this  is one night in Delhi I feel like  accumulating those experiences are also  part of your work early we're doing  something new yeah absorbing so many new  things you're like whoa yeah it'll  reflect somewhere you know in a way now  that I hear this uh hear you say this I  realize that it's actually good that you  have someone who will have your back  yeah yeah yeah because the advice that  he'll give you nobody else will and I  know because I have genuine friends in  the content creation industry and you  know have I looked at their success and  felt like oh [ __ ] you know I could have  been there yes but I think it's human  tendency to constantly like for me yeah  it's human tendency to compare your  journey with other people even if  they're your friends but I've realized  that it's okay if it's a trans it's a  transient feeling and eventually if  you're also feeling happy for them then  it's absolutely fine eventually if you  are still feeling happy for that friend  it's it's great but um it's good to have  friends in the same industry because  sometimes they will look out for you  yeah in ways that you don't understand  like yeah for example there there is a  video of mine which  went viral for the wrong reason people  started questioning it with a lot of  comments on it we had a conversation  that night okay I asked him what's wrong  about this video he told you he told me  this uh he told me how they are why  they're receiving it wrong you know if  it makes any difference so I don't think  I can have such conversations with my  best friends who won't understand yeah  the Dynamics of content creation yeah in  fact like I find it so important to have  friends in the same profession also  because other friends may not like you  said understand yeah what your  professional entails yeah like for  example if I crave about my follower  account decreasing friends they'll call  it a first world problem  we're having a Saturday night uh Google  meet call just come there yeah and if I  tell that to my content creator friends  they'll be like okay cool I'll give you  a shout out and you know maybe your  engagement that works that works then I  mean some yeah but  um it's great to have your friends  because I ask these questions because  you know a lot of friends they start  business together and things don't go  well sometimes yeah and then their  friendship breaks oh [ __ ] like it's such  a common thing it's so many movies have  been made on this that you know two  friends that they see a dream together  they work towards it yeah yeah then  something goes wrong along the way but I  think what Jesus said is so important to  know that  the underlining thing is that you are  friends and you never forget that you're  supposed to Hype each other yeah no I  also feel that it's important that we  both have our own individual Brands yeah  and the collaboration just amplifies so  that and these two things how do you  maintain that individual also another  question as professionals not as friends  when you're working together when people  are watching you  now they're seeing you together as a  pair yeah how do you cast your  individual Impressions without trying to  outdo each other so I think our  individual content is a is it different  from each other it's a little different  right yeah that that makes us help stand  out I think because if if we are the  same people doing videos together and  individually it will become boring you  know I think we are little aware yeah I  think we're little different from each  other in terms of individual content  that makes them want to follow us both  well what if one of you gets very viral  because of your individual content I  think both of us have had faces of  having these viral videos yeah okay one  of the other videos every three months I  think we've had one video do well okay  yeah individually which in which the  other person was not there yeah I'm  talking about I think we are fairly  confident that if you do a video  together it will do well yeah because we  are extra careful in amping up the  quality yeah I'm talking about  individual videos every three months at  least is one video which does well for  each other and that doesn't change  I have one more point that I wanted to  add is this guy also one great thing is  he also knew a lot about another  industry which is Tamil film industry  okay which is acted in so much which I I  then I I got it yeah I've done only four  films so that's not so much to me  when I got like a I think he only put me  through to somebody who was looking to  audition people for so I got an  opportunity to act in one Tamil thing  film and this is a completely different  ball game from content yeah so it was so  great to have him there like behind my  back just to be like hey you know what  you can charge this much this is what  you can do this is what you can't do  this is how people are here dude all of  that that was so good I had uh I had  such good friends in the content  creation industry before I got into the  scene who would tell me this is how much  you should charge and there's not  something anybody can tell you exactly  exactly you can never ask that you  you're not supposed to disclose it yeah  I will get back to you yeah I will get  back to you have you ever realized that  um  especially with male friendships a lot  is normalized a lot of bad things are  also normalized between guys because  they understand oh you know it's fine  you're a guy you'll do this you'll say  this you get you get away with a lot  because sometimes your male best friends  don't call you out on things yeah they  don't correct you because it's just so  convenient that you I think I've been  that annoying friend who calls out  everything because I'm I'm fine-tuned I  fine-tuned my head to be politically  right because you put out content you  you and your friends hate you no no yeah  yeah I have this one friend who's uh  very insensitive let's put it that way  he he he says what he thinks there's no  filter to him and I'm that guy like he's  so annoying if he does not like a  content creator he go comment mean stuff  he's a Troll he's a troll and I'm like  will you do that to me if I was not your  friend he's like yeah wow yeah what do  you say to that so every time I and even  when you follow someone right their  comments are surfacing when you read  them you can't ignore it I screenshot  and said to him telling why he's so mean  why like this so he hates me there were  periods where he's blocked me from  Instagram because I can't my monitor is  notorious stuff because you're like uh  yeah so I'm very glad I'm the friend who  calls her stuff because this guy would  be oblivious to all the [ __ ] he says you  know he can be he can ruin someone's day  yeah but I've okay fair yeah what what  about you I think I was in a part where  uh like I was in a phase where we did  not know that we were doing wrong things  because all of us are together and we  were doing like nobody knows better  nobody knows we were in school we were  doing shitty things all the time yeah  not done shitty things yeah in the  recent past I'm a little more aware so  he maintains yes that's what he says but  in college also in the first two years  something it's just you enter College  testosterone is running through you you  don't know what you're doing you're just  a  no okay sorry not your uh you're a mean  person sometimes okay to people and then  slowly  the harm is done you realize right  slowly you realize through what happened  with us all is we started realizing it  together by its second year third year  and now we're like oh you're walking in  a randomly no it kind of us are [ __ ]  kind of you start realizing dude what we  were put but see for example in my  college in my college I was ragging yeah  and we got ragged in first year and we  naturally assume that when we go to  second year or something we also have to  Rag and that's what we ended up doing  for a long time and that's when you're  trying to put on that bravado that mask  or all that [ __ ] and then do that again  so you're doing all of that and then  slowly third year we realized that this  is a very toxic cycle because when  you're in first year 50 years are coming  and telling you this is how you should  be passouts are coming and telling you  this so that's what you think is true so  it took us to the third year to realize  that you know what this is not correct  this is not okay we stopped by then dude  everything you say I relate so much  because I had to say architecture yeah  you're an architect yeah oh that's why  okay okay yeah because the first day you  dragged so badly yeah the second year  you're like I'm gonna claim my space  exactly and third year like what was the  point of all of this exactly like people  are mean to me and in return I was mean  to random people yeah yeah how does that  make sense it does and then that's when  we stopped now when we went back to  college also yeah he was he was very  woke in college he walks and he asks he  randomly is Jonas will be walking he  stops them you're going good no I can  see so much stress on your face no  that's because they were first years who  came up to us and they were like damn  sure man yeah no these guys were these  guys are first year architecture people  who came  yeah he studied in the most engineering  college but he picked architecture nit  trichy  but architecture so I think you have a  different problem from him yeah I think  he was mostly lagged by Engineers  certainly no no no architecturally that  yeah there's one yeah so um  so like I was saying not to make the  discussion serious but I just think this  this should be addressed why not uh a  lot of times like for example if a  couple fights and the guy is being an  [ __ ] and he's done something  problematic when he goes back to his guy  friends his guy friends rarely tell him  that oh you shouldn't have done that  they they kind of support they tell him  yeah but you know you shouldn't have  done that but you know what do we do  sometimes it happens and you know a lot  in in male groups a lot of times male I  find some things very problematic about  male bonding also yeah a lot of times  men Bond over the worst things yeah  there's so much to bond over like we've  discussed in this episode which is why I  wanted to bring this towards the end  then what is the reason that you Bond  over objectification of women in your  WhatsApp groups yeah like I'm sure  growing up we've all been a part of  those WhatsApp groups and it took me a  while to exit them because when you do  that then they're like oh why are you  becoming such an activist why do you  want to do this and you know like  sometimes at someone your own moral  compass shifts and theirs haven't yeah  I've actually seen this a lot where in  other friend circles in my own College  itself there have been people one guy  did nasty [ __ ] to a girl like and the  others in that group they didn't call it  out call it out at all and we were back  there  seeing this yeah yeah yeah correct  correct it normalizes things for others  who haven't done it yet but will think  that oh he also did it what's the big  deal yeah and I can always come back and  tell him yeah so that felt very and we I  also we tried having a conversation with  this guy also just two of us we were  like dude do you think it was okay to do  what you did on something he's like hey  I was feeling angry and I was like okay  that's not yeah but it's but it doesn't  go through them also it they want to  take it in a receptive way like oh yeah  I did something wrong and that doesn't  happen you know especially with male  bonding for example when I would uh a  lot of times when you for example in  offices when you sit to have lunch with  just men and there is no woman around  there's a way mental yeah yeah there's a  way men talk about women and everybody  bonds over the fact oh this is the only  space where we can do this which they  think is a good thing they don't realize  that it's not even this should not be  it's not it shouldn't happen yeah yeah  there should be no safe space for this  yeah for objectification for example or  talking like saying lewd things about  women in the office and I have been in  so many groups I've been in so many  situations and it's so difficult to just  get up and tell them that dude stop yeah  but I think this happened recently to a  friend of mine yeah who's never dated  before okay and he got married recently  he has never had a female companion but  he was he married he's married now so we  went to because he he luckily after his  marriage he shifted to Goa officially  like they placed him in Goa yeah so when  we went for Holiday we stayed in this  place then we realized that this guy is  still cracking jokes  with his wife watching it and I was so  glad the other friend I was with was in  the same line with me like the jokes  didn't get  responses yeah okay and his wife was  getting really awkward then we had to  sit and explain to him telling listen  this is not okay  he he was like why are you not laughing  it's not funny or what then we went back  home we had to explain to him on the  WhatsApp group telling forget it's  telling these jokes in front of your  wife I think these jokes are no more  jokes I think we have to grow out of it  I think I never had the opportunity to  watch him through the face in college  and all because we were school friends  right I met him after this whole period  of maturing if you can call it that so  I'm so glad the other friend of mine was  also in same lines with me because it's  very awkward when you confront a friend  alone yeah rather than confronting a  friend they get defensive they don't  yeah learn and also I think it's a lot  to do with ourselves also we don't want  to be the outcast also now because like  for example there have been people who  have told me to my face that you know we  don't want to discuss things in front of  you because then you become all like oh  you should know this friend received it  the same way yeah but then he realized  his wife also maybe had a talk with him  or something maybe he came back to  telling but it's because his wife was  involved so he understood what I'm  saying it it shouldn't be that way even  if she was not there right exactly even  or not that's what I'm telling I'm so  glad the other friend was with me was in  line with me if he had laughed for the  joke the whole scenario would have been  different you know as men we've all been  in situations where a bunch of men are  bonding they may not be your best  friends they must just be like yeah yeah  organizers whatever oh yeah oh yeah oh  yeah and they say a lot of Success  Street and we just sit there and we  don't say much yeah yeah we don't say  much and I think that I wanted to  address this on the podcast because I've  I realized that we've talked such good  things about male friendships and that  should be the basis of male friendship  and not all of you uh finding a space  where you can openly share like porn  share pictures of girls from Instagram  and sing rude things about them that's  not male bonding that's just you finding  that's just you finding excuses yeah  yeah to be [ __ ] I think we both  actually  bonded over that also about where we  were with someone some producer of some  show who kept making  sexist comments okay telling that  someone was unfunny because they are  from a particular gender something there  were points where we looked at each  other yeah as he was making those he was  not close enough for us to confront him  and tell him bro he should not do this  okay he was we didn't even it was the  first time we met him so I don't think  we were comfortable enough to have a  conversation we just want to get out of  the place we spent an entire night  discussing about how sexist this guy was  so I think that's another reason why we  became close because we had multiple  topics other than content creation where  you get each other very similar also  also we realize that our moral compass  to some degree is at the same plane so  that really helps I think yeah makes  sense but like you just said you can't  just say it to someone because you're  not close enough  but I think you should you should but  you know like one part of my brain says  that oh you should you should stand up  and call it out right there but the  other part says that  yeah like how doable is it I'm not I'm  not justifying not yeah it was a very  transactional relationship we shared  with this guy but maybe like you said  now while I was narrating the story I  felt like I should have I think they  called him out I think the Crux is that  you need to find a way to say it without  making the whole situation awkward yeah  but still in my head no in my head my  way of saying it is there was a good  minute or two awkward silence while he  was making it yeah there was no reaction  then we're like can we just get to it  whatever work we were doing  and that's also in my head that was me  acknowledging that bro we're not finding  it funny yeah you're talking I think if  you don't laugh so in my head I was like  it is I'm not laughing at this no that's  okay in our head no that's a great start  I think like if you don't want to piss  people off you don't want to be very  because some people we don't we didn't  mind pissing him off because he's not  that close but we should have probably  verbally yeah I think that's what I work  on I work on ways to say things without  making it sound very confrontational so  that the person gets so awkward that  they don't want to learn they get  defensive and then they don't learn and  I also feel that so much conversation  about women safety this that but the  onus is on men to change right and I  think if you understand something is  wrong and if you don't tell that to the  guy the woman will not get a chance to  yeah yeah so it's us who have to do it I  know this all of this sounds preachy but  I just thought that you know why not  discuss this  I think also to some degree we don't do  it because we know that internally only  it comes if if you're going to go  through change for example in college in  first year or something  hey you're doing this is wrong I would  be very defensive exactly and I would be  like this is not but slowly through  third year now you start seeing multiple  but then the people you ragged you still  ranked them right now but again but  again someone calling you out would have  been the first step to yeah yeah  recognizing something wrong I might  Rebel it but still there's a question  even if you stop doing it out of fear  that's still better than you doing it  anyway yeah yeah yeah so I think it's  important but I also get when people say  like you just can't get up and leave  from every table that you're a part of  but I guess the trick is then if you  can't get up and leave then find a way  to tactfully tell them yeah yeah we're  all working on like don't ignore it yeah  but I think that really helped I think  we should thank you for surfacing that I  mean when you talk about male bonding  and stuff  um you have to address this yeah yeah  because a lot of WhatsApp groups are  like so shitty oh yeah the things they  say are just crap yeah like they even  talk about their dates in a very crass  way the yeah I have an issue with that  right we discussed this yeah I cannot  stand it it's not DIY for me also not  forget me opening up I don't want to  know what happened in your date also if  it's going to go in that line it gets  uncomfortable it gets uncomfortable yeah  Fair now let's move on to the next  segment which is yeah sure kind of the  last segment it's called  which basically means let's do something  Bros I guess I don't know so I'm gonna a  lot of South Indian movies have been  remade in Bollywood so I'm gonna say the  Bollywood name and let's see if I can  guess the original the original the OG  movie okay yeah okay and you know  Malayalam movies why does he look like  he doesn't even want to participate no  that's a poker face that is a resting  [ __ ] face like you have a resting  foreign  don't question the question I'm sorry  sir and  um  last  yeah now we're gonna end this podcast by  asking the last question which is if you  were to define the modern gentleman in  one word what would it be  modern gentlemen in one word  I think be aware aware interesting yeah  be aware be aware of the privilege you  have and be make sure you don't  you don't take it as an advantage  it's acknowledge a privilege and act to  it act accordingly you know it's so  important yeah yeah I think a modern  gentleman is is unnecessarily gifted  with a lot of privilege but of course  which a woman does not get so be  considerate and gentle about it that's  why you're a gentleman otherwise you're  just a modern man  hmm yeah what about you  humility no no humidity humility no  because I think humility doesn't do  justice to what I was trying to say I  think it's just like you have to always  be on the lookout to grow as a person  and to just keep your mind open Seeker  maybe that sounds like a Harry Potter  thing but with which we're certainly  playing but yeah I mean yeah it makes  sense you're you're just you should be  open to grow as a person and not just  stick to your core rigid beliefs that's  a beautiful note to end this episode on  thank you so much for being here thank  you so much for giving us your time it  was a great conversation I've never met  you

press the Bell icon so  that the next time the episode comes up  you get a notification we are very  different and we're both men but his  idea of being a man is this  [Music]  so it's kind of like a slap to the  society  what about you know the head of there  [Music]  idea of beauty the society you should  look like this  [Music]  hello everyone this is ankush bhagna you  have tuned in to yet another episode of  the gentleman show by the man company  first of all thank you so much for  sticking around and showing this podcast  so much love we really really appreciate  it  is  which is why it's so important to start  a conversation about men's sexual health  and sexual problems and today we have  our guest Dr pratik makwana Who is also  a content creator  pratik is good enough okay so pradik can  you explain to everyone what you do  well I am a consultant embryologist  which means  that's the easiest way to say it is  bothered okay and I'm guessing that your  parents are also supportive because yeah  they're also doctors so they understand  my love for medical field they're very  happy with it  because you've been observing because  I've been observing growing around them  because there would be so many open  conversations in your household about  yes Sexual Health sexual problems and I  think most of us can't relate right now  no because that is exactly what I feel  because when I grew up went to school  went to my you know degrees  so when was the first time you got to  know about sex  foreign  foreign  practice  are your parents listening to this  podcast do you think they would be I  think they would be so what is so just  say sex is an uncomfortable conversation  tomorrow what is an uncomfortable  conversation  yet I have never had an uncomfortable  conversation with my parents  not no no no not relationships  somehow they've been very cool which is  I think a blessing but they were cool  about telling you about sex but they all  were also as cool about say the fact  that he was sexually active  okay  if you're born in a family of doctors  that you know some conversations just  probably become easier my content would  only be genuine or would only I would  only be able to help people if I  generally believe in it because  some of them will watch my content  [Music]  when I'm talking to them face to face so  not sex positive  yeah the patient will get scared then  what are the kind of  yeah this is for people to know if they  if you visit a doctor for any of your  sexual health problems what are the  questions that a doctor can ask  questions  yeah but they're important they're  important so uh how many times say you  have sex in a week this is important  like this is information that a doctor  should know just so that information  that I would want because  the main goal for them is to have a baby  what is it what is the frequency of your  uh sexual intimacy yeah do people get  uncomfortable answering it yeah in  English  so average calculator  okay understood so like what about maybe  a question what about for example gay  people it's still not very talked about  like uh sex between two men is not very  openly talked about yes so when someone  comes to you and talks about like a  sexual health problem or a regular  problem related to sex how comfortable  they are they to admit that they've been  having sex with the same gender  so I will tell you what you know  in these cases  when they come to the hospital they've  already prepared themselves  because if you don't know what question  you'll ask them yes so for them  pregnancy is obviously not the point  yeah for them the point is how do we  have safe sex huh right yeah how do we  uh like you know not get infected how do  we make sure it's not very painful all  that so  um  they have been planning to come to the  hospital for the last six months seven  months  so they have a certain mental makeup  okay we are ready to answer but then how  do you as a doctor ensure key the  comfortable answering these questions  because  obviously there but it's also so  important to make the patient feel and  this is a topic where people may not  want to talk about certain things like  for example how many sexual partners  have you had do you have a lot of  casuals except yes  even if they are having sex casual sex  with a lot of Partners they may not want  to say they might want to say it yeah  exactly so excuse me you don't ask a  kitchen a partner just simple okay do  you have multiple partners  right so they don't have to go into the  details and you get your answer okay and  Asaka be aware that you felt that it's  difficult to help this person because  this person is very like not ready to  divulge details and then what have you  done so in in this in these cases you  for history taking job which is what we  do we take the history of the patient  it's very uh tricky especially in these  sensitive cases  you have to ask you have to be very  patient with them you don't have to be  the patient yes you have to be patient  with the patient Okay so  I mean usually you can get out the  information  no maybe they need someone else like  some some people in good treatment  counseling do we refer them to the right  person right okay you have come to us  and we may not be able to help you but  we know who can help you right like if  someone gets an STD is it going to be an  expensive Affair I'm asking my parents  they would want to deal with it  themselves  STD is not an expensive affair because  the most you will be asked to do STD is  sexually transmitted diseases I mean we  don't use that word we use infections  now so STI Ultra care difference STD or  STM because when you say diseases it  becomes a little bit uh offensive to the  patient so you say infections so STI  STIs infection which means it's not  expensive the most they'll give you  they'll give an antibiotic they give you  an anti-fungal different depending on  what infection you have okay  topical treatments medical grade creams  yes so in Easy terms just tell our  listeners what is a sign that you may  have in STI any like generic signs  someone who's sexually active and has  not even thought about the fact  but what are the common signs  yes so I mean Common Sense pain in the  genital regions TK itching severe  itching sometimes there's fluid so  itching could be because of sweat also  it could be because of yeah but severe  reaching you are itching on it okay so  that is a sign that you may have some  infection okay okay then you start  getting uh say foul smelling you know  fluids your urine when you're when you  go to the washroom it's painful  it's burning urine so that those signs  of bacterial infections fungal  infections and they could be sexual they  could not be sexual yes they so they're  two types  and STIs symptoms  but when you go when you give your  history  no very very unlikely unless  foreign  now let's talk about the stigma around  this STI how how common are STIs in like  say of today's generation because like I  mean today's generation is probably  having more sex with more Partners than  the previous generations on an average  I'm guessing so what how common are STIs  amongst men this is a crazy statistic  okay and This concerns one particular  virus which is HPV human papilloma virus  okay okay this is one of the major  causes of cervical cancers  and now  around 80 to 83 percent low who are  sexually active at some point have had  HPV  what yes yes sometimes the reaction  doesn't happen otherwise dies down 8 in  10 people yes who have had sex yes would  have HPV yes and this is also the only  sort of cancer or risky vaccine  which is  because India may still for boys  nine to fifteen years  [Music]  as hopefully they will increase the Gap  because job is actually active range  after 45 the advice you don't take it  but 45 seconds  but I still wouldn't I mean boys  [Music]  so that's your personal opinion as a  doctor but yes obviously I mean  hopefully sometime we update  [Music]  um  so what are the other common  stiske according they're more common  than we think yes syphilis genital warts  syphilis  so when you get infections when you get  when you start getting symptoms now so  when you come to the hospital test only  blood tests  like if if you have urine urine test  over your sample  levels  are like what boils yeah but it's a  different it's a different texture than  boils  amongst uh sexually active people are  very common yes and everybody needs to  keep an eye out for the symptoms but  having said that much  so what do you have to say about that  I mean it's very difficult to stop on  Google here once you it's a rabbit hole  it's a and especially if you open the  images  yes but images  [Music]  so you go to your hospital  we have to simplify it to level one for  people listening to this if you're  sexually active  foreign  so here is not a lot  and at least if something God forbid  something happens you can nip it in the  bud right then before it gets do stras  go out of hand yes they can they can  other if they're left unchecked they are  left unchecked then they can cause a lot  of problems  sexual problems  you know they they don't like a lot of  people don't know about these little  infections which can grow big like  you're saying foreign  okay what are the other common things  that men face so they can face a  situation which is called bent penis  what's made the penis is 90 degrees for  bent that's very painful because  it's damaged okay and now by Scar Tissue  so is it bent once it's erect or it's  it's bent once it's erect so it gets  very painful okay so that must be very  painful very good very painful erection  sometimes happen for no reason yes so  yeah so that also you know discourages  that person to get aroused so now they  will go for the treatment surgery yoga  but guarantee  oh so that is also a situation which  happens but how common is that it's not  fairly common but it's not be known to  happen but if you see whatever is  happening to you you don't have to worry  about how common yes because it's  happening to you Statics yeah exactly if  it's happening to you just don't feel  any shame in see it's a problem and  problems can be solved  and sometimes they're not even problems  they're just so uh  you know something like would you say  that erectile dysfunction or premature  or ejaculation are problems that need to  be solved okay that depends on what the  cause is  if it's due to some disease because  erectile dysfunction  if your heart is having a problem  cardiovascular disease  I won't get erect  it could be a gateway to a  cardiovascular problem yes yes  cardiovascular problem and diabetes they  represent themselves through rectile  dysfunction  not always but quite a lot of times so  should people if someone has erectile  dysfunction which basically means they  can't get hard yeah is it like they  can't get hard or they lose their  erection very quickly so they cannot get  hard or even if they get hurt it's not  firm enough for a penetration okay  that's erectile dysfunction and then  this is  depressed depression can play  um  I think it's yeah and there's so much  conversation on how mental health can  actually  you know uh when you ejaculate before  you want it to  now  um  men would want to last for like uh  but this is involuntary ejaculation  you're just in the moment  okay like it's not like you felt it  coming or like but you try to control it  but when it just happened  he's not in your control it's not in  your control is it supposed to be  yeah you can control it okay  okay so uh but time limit which is one  minute if it's repeatedly happening  under one minute either during  intercourse either before intercourse  does this one minute mean that the  moment you start with the foreplay also  yeah people have it Dutch say they can  jack it okay so that is also premature  ejaculation one minute is it only one  minute of penetration alone or is it one  it's the one minute  okay it could be one to two minutes  including it but you know people will  like I have I have heard of people who  would overcome to me and they've been  like you know like but just when I'm  about to enter I ejaculate  so I haven't even started the  Intercourse and ejaculate  but the moment I'm going to yeah  penetrate that moment  and why does that happen  so again depends on the causes okay  coffee coffee bar you can try different  techniques this is a start and stop  method where you when you was  masturbating you go to a point where  about ejaculate because at that time  usually you know prematurely people can  control  okay only it's during the app Japanese  so you can go to that point stop wait  for a few minutes again bring yourself  to that point stop so these are some uh  practicing control yes okay practicing  your muscular control if muscular  control right if it's due to a nervous  cause they can just say Parkinson's  disease  you have to be treated specifically for  the symptom right  particular symptoms you have to be  treated so tell me one thing about uh  you tell them  how many times do they actually go ahead  with it or they just like stop coming to  you after that like I told you it's  other usually medications  I'm pretty sure like because my friends  have told me that they could not afford  to let anyone in their lives know that  they were taking medication for STIs see  now that's their personal cause there's  no issue usually I mean if you take a  medicine say sometimes why are you  taking medicine  depends on the age yeah like I mean  someone who's in college maybe  so much of a personal space in their  house but even even adults they don't go  and talk about having STIs to their  parents  you just said like that antibiotics  anti-fungals  do not call anybody so  like so then I'm guessing that if to all  my listeners the graph look diagnosed  with the sexual health problem or you  see symptoms and you doubt it you should  immediately tell your partner yes if  that is very important especially with  like casual sex of links you should  inform them so that even if you're not  planning to meet them again they should  be careful yeah because otherwise  it'll be a chain reaction and it's also  not a nice thing to do to someone if  you've known that you may have given  this infection to someone  just like it's also not a nice thing if  you know you have that infection please  don't go and have sex  if someone is into casual sex and they  are doubting  should they immediately just stop having  sex it's better I got doubt here so why  risk it  very well and good for your pieces  people don't think about other people so  much sometimes yes they're like and  that's what we have to change  it the test won't take a lot of time  we'll take  and I want to talk about how it's  difficult for men to acts  premature ejaculation acceptance  because  um  so nothing can be wrong with the men  right  mentalities  because they will look like less of a  man right so you've explained it very  well actually ma'am yeah makes sense  they can be flawed how do they deal with  how do they deal with it but then what  do you want to say to them yeah see I  mean  now the times are changing it's  important to accept you know it's  important to accept that yes the  problems can be both men and women they  have equal incidences of problems equal  incidence of sexual health issues  address  yes  one third of cases are due to men  one third of cases because women notice  these are unexplained courses  but it's just not happening yeah  okay let's blame luck for that  bad luck yeah it's bad luck but your  infertility  what is infertility because a lot of  people are mistake erectile dysfunction  for infertility a lot of people mistake  um  premature ejaculation for infertility  per info infertility pleasure  infertility is very technical yes so  infertility is when you have been trying  for a pregnancy for say around one year  huh  Excel you have tried unprotected  intercourse  not successful then you go for an  infertility workup objective  erectile dysfunction premature  ejaculation can lead to infertility  because it's stopping you from having  sex so you're not having a baby so it  can be not reaching the ovaries that is  the okay but infertility  that you ejaculate a lot  but then you still can't yes yes which  is low sperm count right could be low  sperm count it could be the sperm's  movement is affected motility yes  motility morphology or count wow like  going to school all over yeah  normal sperms are enough to cause a  pregnancy  four percent four percent that's when we  say is  there has to be zero shame attached to  this word like yeah I mean it's a it's a  it's a medical thing it is beyond your  control I'm guessing there is nothing to  be ashamed of here and you should openly  talk about it if not your family then at  least to your doctor for sure and uh if  someone is infertile it doesn't mean  that they can't enjoy sex no they can't  enjoy sex unless I mean unless if it's a  cause of erectile dysfunction that's a  different thing even then there can be  other ways to enjoy sex counseling I  mean see counseling multiple ways of  intimacy penetration is not just the  only way  multiple ways of intimacy plus  counseling can help whatever the  treatment is you can take treatment for  that it can help you get back to normal  right I mean you don't have to live with  erectile dysfunction it's treatable  sperm count low hair but in terms of  like erection and sexual performance  everything is great but the sperm count  is everything is great but the sperm  countries so by that logic you can still  enjoy sex now for the pleasure of it  yeah you can you can but then in this  case when it comes to infertility I  think they avoid time and return keep us  when they want a child so now they also  treat sex as a means to get a child but  that has always been the case is just  that now humans are one of the few  species that also have sex for pleasure  and not just for procreation yes  not the purpose of sex so an  archiculture science  multiple ways to assist you right yeah I  mean if and if nothing works out there's  always adoption which is a great thing  great option I think it's a it's the  best option because you're giving home  to someone who really needs it it's a  brilliant option yeah but it also comes  down to what people want you know coffee  Cycles  you know maybe we should go for adoption  so it's obviously an option it can be an  option from the first step you don't  even have to go through idea yeah and  infertility doesn't have to Define your  sex life or erectile dysfunction or  whatever it doesn't Define your married  life it doesn't Define your Milestones  of life and it also doesn't Define your  masculinity yes let's spell it out it's  absolutely okay there's nothing wrong  with you and um  let's talk about  let's talk about  genital hygiene it's not talked about  yeah  what counts as genital hygiene what is  what are the things that you should not  be doing what is unhygienic can these  lead to UTIs can these lead to STIs can  these lead to other infections STI is  the name because they are thinking Nami  is actually transmitted UTI is yes  now genital hygiene is important  please just change your underwear every  day and just use a normal soap not to  not too scented your body wash could be  Basics and warm water just maintain that  and if you sweat a lot if you go to the  workout come back  it's as simple as that but do you think  it's it's an issue it's an issue as a  doctor do you see cases where they  haven't maintained uh genital hygiene  it's it's an issue and it's so so common  Matlab it should  clean your genital regions  tell us the most ridiculous masturbation  myths Ridiculousness blindness  what yes if you masturbate you'll go  blind  a dad is talking to his child okay now  if you masturbate you'll go blind child  is sitting on the sofa dad is looking at  a wall  okay  yeah I'm sure  the coffee Club  recently which I addressed on my story  it does swallowing semen cause pregnancy  is  it's a sham  it started  as a way to you know counter Pawn  addiction but Logan airport  and it started as a moment against  masturbation  so is it the same as key self pleasure  should not be there like I mean in this  case it's the same thing yeah  okay you don't pleasure yourself your  sperms this is a thing which I've heard  it's very prevalent okay you will hear  it someday on YouTube only  okay if you don't Master it no your  sperms will go through your body to your  brain and it will get you increased  focus and increased stamina  and this happened this new podcast okay  so uh you can masturbate as many times  as you want unless it's interfering with  your daily life  so addiction masturbation addiction it's  just that you are masturbating it is  you're only thinking about masturbation  that's something that you need to then  reduce the frequency or work on because  that is obviously every interfere with  your life and your productivity right  other you are going wrong but otherwise  what do you have to say about men who  think that it's  because it's more pleasurable it's a  it's a very rampant  thing amongst men  it's it's all in the head but using  condom or not using condom will not  affect your Sensations or plus essay  condoms  which give you like a sort of a real  feel you know it's not exactly uh latex  condoms um  so you'll get a different feel so yeah  this also stems from the fact that  all the issues that we talked about talk  about about sexual health and all  they're like women's sex sexual health  issues are talked about and Men  sometimes don't want to take the  responsibility  you know harmful Healthcare but they  still expect the woman to do it and I  think also because men don't think that  unprotected sex  that is a very good point because you  know emergency contraception that pill  is filled with hormones and it's  emergency yes it's for emergency which  should not happen every week every month  every two months every three months huh  so you use a condom save all that and  also like unprotected sex is also  dangerous for men it's not like only  women it is dangerous what what can  happen with unprotected sex the only way  to prevent an STI transmission is using  a condom koi pill koi method of  contraception only a condom can prevent  pregnancy  STI so contraception  from unwanted pregnancies  so I think this has to be one learning  from this podcast for all the young men  all men listening to this right now it's  like just sex can be enjoyable and very  pleasurable even when it's safe so  yeah do you do you have to say anything  on like a  um  I think there's only one thing that I  would like to say to all the men who say  condoms safe sex is the greatest sex you  can have  um  interesting okay cool you heard it from  right from you know the horse's mouth  and uh now we have our next segment  which is called  where I want you to give sex tips okay  I'm laughing but it's it's gonna be  useful for people here just tell people  some things that they can follow in sex  which will make sex better so there are  three tips that I'll give three tips  which can probably lead to many more  tips first is communication  second is consent so it is quantum a  five marker questions you've given one  marker answer these are these are the  three C's of six oh three C's of sex  okay now we're talking like a Content  create a text  what are they communicate with your  partner okay you can explore a lot more  if a lot more ways you know of having an  intimate relationship with a partner if  you just talk right what sorry  boundaries you can explore huh  your partner will also be safe no one  wanted pregnancies right no infections  and consent yes  that's great advice yeah thank you so  much for saying that and now this has  brought me to the last question of this  podcast Define the modern gentleman in  one word  okay one word  I would say aware  oh okay explain Karo because  like people are open to accepting men  can be infertile men can have sexual  health issues  are now you know like happening  invincible  so now they're becoming more aware not  just of their own sexuality of other  people's sexuality as well  so that that is one thing which I think  has improved both Improvement  or at least  but thank you so much uh for doing this  prateek this was a very fun conversation  and I think uh you by coming on this  podcast and talking about all of this  have normalized all of these things for  so many men out there to a certain  extent and you're also doing that with  your content so thank you so much for  that uh it was great having you on this  podcast this is me ankush bahuguna  signing off from the gentleman show by  the man company until I see you in the  next episode  and remember to always have safe sex bye  foreign,M,2644,85,1,"Oct 28, 2022"

slap to the  society  what about you know the head of there  [Music]  idea of beauty the society you should  look like this  [Music]  hello everyone this is ankush bahugna  and you have tuned in to yet another  episode of the gentleman show by the man  company jaha preham how to  suspects episode  um  it could just be an emotional roller  coaster  um because today we're going to talk  about  mental health emotional breakdowns and  grief and yeah  so I want you all to make yourself some  coffee sit in a Cozy Corner get  comfortable because  and today we have with us two very  special guests stand-up comedian and  psychologist  hi thank you Rose hi hi  okay so let's get started yes sir okay  so situation  but are you are you are you nervous  about talking about it or no I stopped  giving the first rule of mental health  is put yourself first prioritize  yourself  any prioritize I don't care about  anybody else I think we've started with  a great lesson yeah that makes a lot of  sense and a lot of people like this is  what therapy also teaches you right that  you your mental health is a very  important aspect and you need to give it  as much importance as you can and um  let's start from the basics yeah so I  think a lot of people don't know the  difference so this I'm really glad you  asked this question a psychologist does  therapy though if you want therapy go to  a psychologist and they can also  diagnose you a clinical psychologist to  be precise and a psychiatrist gives  medicine so usually they don't do  therapy so if you go to a psychiatrist  and expect them to not give you medicine  that's not going to happen okay so then  how do you decide psychologists  so if you think you have a disorder then  you can go to a clinical psychologist or  a psychiatrist clinical psychologist  will give you therapy and diagnose you  and a psychiatrist will give you  medicine so if you are someone who can't  really afford therapy and would you  don't think you have the capacity to go  through to it like the whole deep issues  and also pay for it then I would suggest  in India go to a psychiatrist because  it'll give you a quick fix  I mean it will is there is there a quick  fix for mental health no not really but  then for a lot of people medicine is  necessary because right they have no  option like therapy also doesn't work  and maybe they can't afford it  accessibility is a big issue here right  exactly so it can help yeah so um  and then the psychologist tells you  whether you need to go to a psychiatrist  or not that's that's what that's what I  would suggest because medicine isn't for  everyone you don't always need medicine  and a Clinical Psychology  if you if they think you need a  psychiatrist right and uh coming to you  have you ever seek therapy yep you have  yeah okay and what was the experience  like can you tell us  a lot actually uh see mental health does  not have a physical attribute largely or  it's not a broken bone you're not  bleeding so it is very hard to see  something and not take it seriously in  India a lot of times going to Theory  means your power  and it is looked down upon  especially when you want to seek help  and you can't and you don't have a I  have an answer around what you want to  do who do you go to how to get help  um is when therapy is needed uh why did  I go to therapy because I was going  through a phase in my life that I had no  reasoning  that I could put across in the way I was  feeling about my life in general  which can be suicidal which can be  absolutely not able to get out of your  bed  now issue with therapy or especially  with mental health is that since it  doesn't have a physical symptom to it  you're not bleeding there is no broken  bone  people don't see how impactful it is for  a person in their mind and um  it is tough to get out of bed it is  tough to even connect to somebody you  can be in the middle of the absolute  busy market and feel absolutely lonesome  um you see Darkness around  and that thing is so underrated and so  unrevolved in India  and I'm just talking about India because  I am a citizen of India so I wouldn't  know about any other country would be  very wrong for me to comment on that  if that is when I was suggested I need  to go seek therapy and people like  divija mentioned she's a psychologist  they're a clinical psychologist as well  um they get trained to understand in a  nutshell how do I put it they train they  trained they educate and then practiced  enough to understand a deeper meaning  behind a thought process which is  pulling you down because when we're  happy  with  so that is what a clinical psychologist  or a psychologist or a therapist will do  for you and then accordingly you take  further steps of either talking about it  and seeking medical help like she said  going to psychiatrist you know can be  anything mood stabilizers there are a  lot of things such a varied concept  right  um you take medicine if you if you're  prescribed for medicines and you do  activities when they tell you how to  disconnect how to connect the right  things you know million things therapy  is not it's like different stocks for  different folks so that's what led me to  it and I've never been happier or I've  never been more thankful about the  things in life that I should have  known earlier yeah I mean I mean I used  to stand on the rooftop of my house and  look down and it's like if I jump today  I'll end it and that is what I wanted to  do  and that's a thought which crosses to I  think everybody's mind at least once in  their life  yeah I mean I'm  I'm pretty sure that a lot of our  listeners would also you know some of  them could I hope nobody relates to ever  relates to this but I'm sure that mental  health  and you know these are things that we  bottle up inside us like a lot of people  feel these things you know like what if  I die today what if you know what is the  reason of my existence  you know nothing is going right in my  life even though to an outsider it might  seem like your life is perfect you know  like for example you you're perceived as  a funny guy correct they're always  questions  right you look a certain way like the  vision looks the way she looks the way  you look up healthy  huh and that's what I keep telling them  it is not about what you're looking at  it is about how they are not looking at  the same thing and how they're feeling  exactly so I can give you a compliment  like for example somebody is going  through BPD which is borderline  personality disorder if I tell divija  I'm just taking an example not trying to  pull you down if it tells you that they  would look really nice today a normal  human being will say thank you very much  and take it as a compliment a person  with BPD probably will understand oh I  do not look good in any other thing but  this but I was not looking good  yesterday oh it is a very different  tangent of you accepting knowing  acknowledging things so let therapists  like psychologists do their bit  we can't be doing this at home they are  trained for it right makes sense so if  if you want to talk about it sure  absolutely no pressure but I just feel  the more we talk about our personal  experiences the more it will normalize  things for people true so then what what  was it in your life what was that phase  in your life and you felt like um there  was no reason to live four five years  ago I think uh what was the reason for  it is what I couldn't figure out I drive  a very big car iced in a very big  palatial house I have a good healthy  bank balance  [Music]  um  I have a beautiful mother at home I have  two dogs you know the idol scenario you  have a younger brother who's married  he's got kids  um I was dating this woman back then who  I got married to eventually oh  um  I couldn't figure out I would cry for no  reason  um I would stare for no reason I just  couldn't figure out and a lot of people  think for example a kid with ADHD is  a lot of these basic values interesting  values of a lot of people we don't  understand I'll give you an example when  before tari zameen par came as a movie  we had no idea what autism was dyslexia  or dyslexia sorry we had no idea what  dyslexia was yeah  tables  no other reason but to cope and you know  build trauma inside probably yeah  probably  um so I for me I had no idea what was  the reason right so I couldn't talk to a  lot of people because I know they won't  understand that is the part I know  so then  I I get it but I'm asking like any other  person who doesn't understand mental  health very correctly would correct so  if everything was going fine then why  did you why did you have these thoughts  that you didn't want to live anymore  because in when I went to therapy they  told me what was the deeper meaning it  can be anything it can be uh impact of  me losing my father when I was four but  that defense mechanism a lot of kids get  molested as kids  male or female right of course they shut  their part that that part down so they  have a massive insecurity with physical  intimacy now when they grow up and uh  they are they are with their partners  and they're still not being able to be  very comfortable physically physically  intimate part they do not know what is  wrong and the partner doesn't know it  either  so that is when people like divija or a  clinical psychologist or a counselor or  a therapist or psychiatrist is where  they come into play  so our problem in case you also we try  to portray everything at home our home  becomes self-proclaimed doctors  which is good but for mental health they  can't do it they'll be like is  um  who don't even drink they don't have  they don't have drugs what do you think  everybody you know this one friend told  me you know this is happening because  sometimes  and she was like  you know like I can't fall asleep I just  can't but you realize it is not that  family's fault also they don't know any  better of course my mother is a beard  double m a beard I can't imagine her to  be a psychologist so she studied for the  division I studied for yeah my mother  hasn't of course so she tries to support  me whenever I cry she's like you roller  what do I tell her I do not know why am  I crying yeah and where does the  conversation start and for that  generation it is so hard to process key  is  yeah it's such a new thing for like even  a lot of us here like  generations  for example I'll be 45 this year  I come from a generation where there was  no cell phone there was no internet  and considering what I do right now I'm  always on the net and I have the  state-of-the-art phone instead of the  art laptop  the good part is or the bad part is that  the older generation wasn't that old is  that I can absolutely disconnect with  current generation and not connect with  them but rather connect with the old  people because the basic theory of for  example sleeping on time or getting up  on time for mental health people who are  going through this it is very hard for  them to sleep so if they come into  routine this is a routine  so if you come into a routine it helps  you actually we don't listen to them we  don't yes  that's the struggle that they can't get  into that routine that stuff actually  that's the symptom it's not the reason  people see it as the reason for our  problems exactly like I mean  some people when they have mental health  problems some of them just can't sleep  in some of them sleep a lot they want to  stay in this because they can't get out  of the bed they can't get out of the bed  yeah like for example when  um when I went through anxiety a major  major uh panic attack which you know I  don't know if it was the same panic  attack that lasted for days but like  there was there were days at stretch  where I would just be  in like hell and I couldn't sleep true  and Lucifer had spoken to someone who  told me that you know like I mean I like  I've been diagnosed with depression and  I just keep sleeping and I binge eat a  lot I've started eating a lot I keep  sleeping I avoid meeting friends I don't  want to step out I can't even work it's  not like my time here correct  so every aspect of a family will  disconnect so for example when you're  sleeping more people will come here I'll  see it when you're eating  when you're not meeting your friends  there's always a term which fixes to you  and then you start living to that term  got a little defensive you what else do  you do that's your comfort zone right  but in in your in your experience was  there like a personal incident that  triggered it or you still don't know why  that suddenly happened in your life so I  was happy to recover out of it I just  didn't want to even portray further as  to what caused it because I had no idea  okay  um had I had an idea I probably would  have avoided it  right so so uh division you tell me uh  logo suddenly episodes for example the  foreign  depression or anxiety or so many other  things yeah so is it always caused by an  incident in your life it can just come  to you anytime  caused by many factors it's not like we  can really  go through many minor things every day  like people will maybe body shame me and  my family growing up and then something  will happen and then my friend will fall  out with me and then I'll have a breakup  all of those things come together so we  actually need to notice our day-to-day  life and not just focus on the day we  got depression like mental health is not  just pathological in the sense just  clinical disorders it's all of us we all  go through good days and bad days so I  think we need to focus on the bad days  and see where they're taking us like are  we sitting and blaming ourselves for  every single thing because that is one  thing that actually contributes a lot to  depression like the way you talk to  yourself that is one of the things so it  doesn't matter what's happening to you  you will anyway talk about yourself in a  bad way even if something good like he  mentioned uh if somebody has borderline  personality disorder even if they don't  have the disorder there's many people  who have low self-esteem so if somebody  if I have low self-esteem and somebody's  like oh you're looking good you're  talking well I'll be like no that's not  true they're lying they're doing that to  make me feel good see you know every  time someone gives me a compliment yeah  um I'm like  yeah okay I don't believe you yeah  exactly I don't believe you yeah and  then people uh you know sometimes people  will say and I'm like you know I can  mask it in humor I can be very like  funny about it or whatever but I know  that when people tell me  I'm like why are people telling me  things that are not true yeah I just  don't believe you true so yeah so these  things are so relatable for so many  people but just the fact that they're  not addressed enough  they keep it to themselves yeah that you  don't tell people this year  people are just is it pity is it a  compliment or is it a pity compliment  it's because people don't take it that  seriously like you yourself like you  wouldn't see this as the biggest problem  in your life or something right so  you'll just see it as a small thing but  then it will keep building up yeah if  you don't notice the pattern yeah like  for example that I have low self-esteem  issues I started noticing yeah aspect of  my life I will constantly doubt myself  even if people tell me I'll seek  validation but when I get the validation  I won't believe it you know what I mean  correct so it is  foreign  that is also coming from the fact that  people don't know what depression is  Right sadness and depression are on a  spectrum to be honest at least that's  how I see it a disorder becomes a  disorder when it's out of your control  completely everyone goes through those  feelings like anxiety everyone goes  through anxiety it's not a disorder  unless and until you reach that part  where it's like Gad generalized anxiety  disorders  but panic attacks that's the thing the  mental health like I said is like an  everyday thing we think it's only about  disorders and extremes it's not like  that it builds into that mental health  some degree so everybody faces a lot of  these things now they may not become  disorders you know you have uh like she  said you you feel anxious at times but  that may not mean that you have  generalized  what do you what do you have to say  about this I think she's put it very  nicely the moment it becomes a disorder  is when it is out of your hand that is  the best way to put it we all go through  it and coming in and out of depression  if you're doing you're just being  ignored and how she said you have no  idea what depression is then do we get  sad yes I get sad looking at anybody  who's begging outside right now in this  sweltering heat yeah I feel bad I feel  bad when a kid is begging I feel bad  when people are physically disabled I  feel bad when somebody is inhuman to  animals I feel bad about a lot of things  I am not getting into depression at that  point and I'm not coming out of it  either that fast so like she said it is  either you tribalize it you glamorize it  you romanticize it romanticize you have  no idea what it is right now you and  probably it is an onset of you getting  into depression probably but that is  where people like her people who are  pro-trained professionals are needed it  is okay to seek help is what we need to  understand and we don't take it is  excellent  so um  and if you can afford therapy just go  for it you can't you can't because  that's also the thing so even right now  when we're talking about it we're only  seeing it in terms of depression anxiety  like disorders kind of you can actually  have it out of your control and not have  a disorder like even people who don't  have disorders have it out of control  and they need help sometimes yeah not  just need you know you should just go to  therapy generally like a doctor like you  go to a doctor for your well-being  mental health is not just these negative  things it's also well-being like feeling  good feeling happy that is also mental  health you know when I went to therapy  um for my anxiety uh my therapist told  me that I have something called  anticipatory anxiety  it ruins everything in my day  things so much  I can't I can't keep up with the  day-to-day life because of it and I  sometimes some some minor things trigger  it like chaos triggers it so much  so for example my therapist told me that  you get hassled you get hassled very  easily so you have to avoid chaotic  situations so like my mother has this  habit she'll ask you 100 questions  so like I've grown up in that  environment  so my day starts like that  that's when my day just you know eight  episode in the morning will give me  anxiety for the whole day  it is started on that note  so then my other therapist told me that  this is probably maybe your trigger  point that you know too many people  talking to you at the same time is you  know will make you chaotic  recognize I started uh just say Indian  families  I had to introduce it I like I shut my  door and sometimes it takes me a while  to get up even now even in general  I don't want to interact with someone  till the time I'm okay  so that's something that I learned in  therapy and I'm not going to therapy  right now because I don't feel the need  for it  but this has stayed with me and this is  something that I apply in my real life  that I just want to exit chaotic  situations or I want to simplify chaotic  situations before panicking true so this  is what therapy does right yeah you're  making boundaries actually with your  family when you're doing this this is a  healthy thing like actually people when  they go through this they just yell at  their mother or like they had to have a  huge fight with their parents  that's what happens normally right  people who don't go to therapists they  don't know that they can actually make  these boundaries without fighting you  have to be calm you have to do it again  and again for them to understand yeah  that's called murdering your parents  I've never told them so um yeah this is  the first time I'm you know they will  know if they listen to this my my  sisters knew but uh I couldn't tell them  because I knew that they may not  understand and I didn't want the  pressure  to explain it to people when I was going  through it myself I was like enough  awareness  and you know I'm independent enough to  take care of the you know money aspect  of it I could afford it so I went for it  correct and then I was like  let's keep myself first and that's what  my therapist told me that you have to do  what makes you feel better right now  true so yeah  um foreign  [Music]  foreign  hospitals on the outskirts of Delhi and  these people who have major disorders  they're just there nobody knows about  them their families is mostly abandon  them because they don't understand what  they're going through and they're just  there I saw that in my internships and I  was like wow I've studied psychology and  I didn't know that this is true there  are big hospitals like he mentioned but  there are also smaller clinics and  hospitals and they're just like these  homes where people are there and they're  just getting taken care of but they  don't really have a proper life if you  think about it their family doesn't care  or they don't know what to do also it's  not their fault do you think um like  this is this is heartbreaking to hear to  be honest  um because I think this is alienation  who can't help it at like you know they  can't help it and they've been put in a  place where they can't live life like  others it's it's heartbreaking but do  you think the more awareness there is  about these things the better it will be  for people like them of course I mean if  you know more then you will actually  take them to the doctor before it gets  too  you can actually tell when somebody is  going through something even in their  young adulthood so you don't have to  wait at least then people will know and  then if people know then there will be  more professionals right now there's  very less psychologists and honestly  even the psychologists that are there  not all of them are good I have seen  really bad psychologists also okay so  the more we know there will be more  educational institutions the training  will get better that's what awareness is  needed foreign yeah  even my psychologist was a woman and  most of my friends who went to cycle  mostly I think all yeah they were women  yes is there I don't know like I'll tell  you why there's like two reasons one is  that um first of all there's this notion  that men don't understand emotions I  mean we all know the stereotype yes  that's why we're here discussing this  yeah thanks for validating the topic  yeah like this is actually true because  I was hiring a psychologist for my team  and I want to include male psychologists  also and I tweeted um would you what  would you prefer or what gender of a  therapist would you prefer everyone  wrote women for some reason they were  like I think it'll be easier for me to  open up they don't realize that it's  actually a gender bias like who said  that men can't understand your emotions  there are plenty of good male therapists  not in India I think for women there may  be a layer of safety maybe there may be  like that underlying layer yeah they'll  feel safer with like opening up to a  woman and being vulnerable to a woman  than being that is understandable in  those cases specific perfectly to like  sexual abuse but even men wrote that  they prefer a woman like men find it  very hard to open up to other men no  yeah so now let's let's also touch upon  if we talk about mental health we can't  do that without touching upon grief  which is such an important part about  everyone's life we've all lost loved  ones  um the first example that I can go back  to was that  um when my grandmother passed away  I could see a difference between  um I could see a pattern amongst the men  and how they were dealing with grief  they were all trying to put a brave  front because you know men are supposed  to do things at a funeral and it's it's  heartbreaking like you know Hindu  Customs when someone passes away and  there are certain things that you have  to do  um that like would uh shake up any any  human being and I've still seen the male  Elders in my house put up such a big  front like they you could see that  they're you know bursting with tears but  they would not cry openly  cool so let's talk about how men deal  with grief  it's not just Men actually grief is very  complex everyone deals with a  differently and there's no right or  wrong so I wouldn't really say them not  processing in the moment is wrong they  have to do it in that moment because the  Customs are like that if they don't do  that then people will shame them that is  why they're doing it again that is not  I'm not going to say that that's  unhealthy or healthy because you can't  expect someone to start coping on the  spot right everybody takes some people  take years to deal with grief and that's  normal it's very common so on top of  that grief is like quite stigmatized in  a society people are expected after a  set number of days they're expected to  go back to work and like that's normal  and if they don't do that people are  like this person is very affected so  they're seen in such a way that like if  somebody Grieves for many years people  will be like why are they grieving for  so many years it's been so long so there  is a lot of stigma about grief it's not  just a gender thing also just grief in  general right and I've only realized  different ways can you know come at you  at some unexpected moments and I'm still  realizing it because I faced like a huge  loss in my family I lost a family member  last year and  I think I spoke about it immediately  um I spoke about the fact that I lost my  sister and no it's okay it's okay I  talked about it at a very early stage  and that time I I felt obviously  devastated but then it is after a month  where it really hit me and this time I  was hyper productive I was like I was  working I just dived into work I was  like okay this has happened in my family  there is no way I can deal with this and  okay it's happened now what and I just  didn't want to face it so I just dived  into work and for one whole month I just  kept working working and then I remember  it would just come back to me  and you know you sometimes feel that and  sometimes I would also during that one  month I was also feeling guilty why am I  not as sad as people are supposed to be  like why is it not affecting me and then  I was like yeah I am sad but I'm not  like crying my eyes out every night but  then one month later I was actually  crying my eyes out every night  yeah so I just realized it's so complex  and that's when I realized here I don't  know if I'm equipped to handle this  grief anymore and it still comes back to  me in random moments that's what  grieving is it's it's forever you grieve  forever it's just that it changes the  way it shows up like in the beginning  and some people might cry some people  might not cry maybe some people will cry  every few months that grieving never  stops it's just it's a process it's not  like a symptom or something yeah because  now now that I think about it I've I've  realized that I'm changing as a person  because of that grief the way I look at  things has changed and sometimes  sometimes it's happening in the  background and sometimes I'm really  disturbed by it how is it still changing  me after like almost a year because you  wanted to  and as in  so for example my father passed away  when I was four I'm sorry I'm 44.  40 years yeah there are days when I miss  him and I cry about it honestly I don't  remember the guy's face  I was four it's very hard to recollect  any memory from there so I look at this  picture I create a story I create a  Persona I put his face in that's how I  create my figment of imagination  so there are days when I feel bad about  him not being there there are days I  consciously think of things that could  have been better if he was around there  are days when I wonder how things would  have been if he was around imagine even  after 40 years 40 years  exactly at four I couldn't grieve at 10  I didn't know what grieving was and what  happens in Indian families the Elder  male child suddenly becomes a man of the  house the day your father passes away so  I became the man of the house when I was  four  I started running right after 12th I'll  be 45 this year  I don't remember  when I was 18.  and I was not born 45. am I happy in my  current situation yes there are times  when I wonder about my mother  how her life would have been different  if my father was alive  uh I'm married with this lovely woman  right now karva chauth comes in  we sit in a park where all those ritual  Customs go through  and I see a lot of older women who would  be my other mother's age  and I remember one day she was telling  me a couple of years ago that  when I was young I used to ask her why  don't you go to that ceremony  because I had no idea right no it is not  wrong  what I feel bad is now she doesn't  remember my father's death anniversary  but I've never forgotten her his death  anniversary 6th of December invariably I  will know six December his father's my  father's death anniversary she started  forgetting  and I don't blame her I think she is now  overcoming that grief at this stage now  and I think that is what David I was  trying to say would you agree forever  yes you do grieve forever yes you do  um my dog passed away five six years ago  every day every day my dog also passed  away a few months ago and I think I've  just been grieving a lot I grieve every  day I have a dog and this is the biggest  fear in my life right I think nobody  talks about how pet loss really affects  you I feel like yeah you you always  think yeah it's just like a pet it's  just a dog but it's not family yeah it's  family we agree forever just get  answering out whatever she was saying  but then after such a big loss  I have considered I've generally  considered therapy and I actually may go  for it because if it's time I'm  realizing that it is you know it is  changing me as a person and um  it seems like in a healthy way but I'm  not sure I'm not too sure if it's  changing me in a healthy way because  it's changed the way I look at things  like sometimes I genuinely feel that I  can you know like hear voices  I genuinely and not like physically but  I can I can tell I can tell that uh you  can hear voices  I mean like sitting at home like  randomly no not like physically here  voices but I can I can hear like I  sometimes find myself having  conversations with my sister oh yeah  yeah like that fantasy Dreams yeah like  I mean and I can't like hear the voice  but I can feel it hallucination you are  talking about fantasy of talking to her  I can feel it I can I can feel her  presence I don't know it's what I how to  define it yeah but it's also I think um  another thing I want to talk about grief  is that have you ever felt that you will  uh come at a point where you will lose  the memories also because I sometimes  feel that I want to hold on to the grief  also I brought this topic up because  there are so many people who had such  terrible losses because the last two  years yeah you know and you know these  so many families have suffered so it's  something which is so heartbreaking but  it's so common right now correct  so I don't know if anybody listening to  this relates with this but I have this  constant fear that I will if I let go of  this grief if I allow myself to get over  it I'll also lose the memories because  as you as you grow older as years pass  you forget things yeah you do and right  now I try every day to remember a new  memory of her yeah so the question is  why are you doing that because I feel  that that's I don't want to let go I  think you think that um maybe you're not  a good brother if you let go you won't  be the right brother yeah yeah because  yeah this is an unrealistic expectation  from yourself a human being will forget  it doesn't make you less of a brother  emotionally because you're not a bad  person for moving on that is actually  what Society wants you to move on right  so it's not a bad thing yeah  yeah and so I just had to do it  we're a big a big guy talk to everyone  who's uh suffered any loss  um in life which a lot of people have in  the recent past  yeah and um on that positive and  upcoming note what is the next question  the next question I'm checking like I'm  just thinking where to drive this  conversation because you know grief is  also not just about people you've  physically lost but people you've also  lost from your life there are people I  want to lose in my life can we grave  over there  people agree toxic relationships as well  like you don't want to be in that  relationship like family members partner  whatever but you you don't want to be  with them but you also have lost them so  you need to understand that just because  your grieving doesn't mean that you want  them back it just means you're grieving  that relationship so this is also  complicated yeah and uh division tell me  how can therapy help people grieving  because the thing is that in in covid  such unexpected you know uh deaths have  happened people have passed away who  didn't have any  um you know it was not expected family  members did not see it coming and it was  a shock yeah so I'm pretty sure a lot of  them it may be a good option for them to  go to therapy so can you tell us about  how therapy can help you so you're  talking about grief counseling that's  like a specific type of thing and in  that  um I think the main thing we would do is  to reduce the shame and guilt and the  complex feelings that you have like for  example I have had clients like the  toxic relationship example they did not  want to be in the relationship and then  that person passed away so there you're  like I'm glad he's gone but I also feel  bad so we help them process that and  clarify those thoughts that what you're  feeling is not wrong you're not a  horrible person for missing them it's  not that you want to be hurt on purpose  it's just that it's like that so there's  so much taboo and stigma first the first  thing we need to do is remove that shame  guilt some people feel guilty they're  like why did I not do enough maybe I  should have done this all these regrets  there's no I also have them I also have  them so grief is not just that feeling  of missing them right it's also shame  guilt regret all of these things people  blame themselves people blame the person  some people are angry at the person like  why did they leave so there's so many  things that happen so we help with those  things and help them understand why  so yeah I mean thanks for telling us  that because uh I'm actually considering  I didn't know that it's called grief  counseling I just thought it's it's the  same as therapy but it's good to know  that it's it's a whole new uh Department  it's not a department but it's a lot of  people who specialize in it like most  people most therapists can do it okay  because itself  these are the best  that's that's their idea of uh that's  their prescription  okay so this brings me to our next  segment which is called oh god um yeah  so  tell us three things you wish someone  had told you before uh that I'm worth it  um  it is okay to make mistakes  important and uh  thought that probably  I'm loved  that's it  what about you division  [Music]  that everyone actually has flaws nobody  is perfect even though it seems like  they have it put together every goes  through anxiety at some point it's not  just me  and  just taking compliment for no reason  yeah and people make  um look at me and criticize me but then  that doesn't change who I am like if I  am someone and they think I'm something  else that doesn't make me that something  else that is another thing that you wish  someone told you yeah okay and the third  thing is that uh I think it's good to be  open-minded and keep changing don't try  to just stay the same forever I think  when people have birthdays we're like  happy birthday stay the same I love you  so I feel like you shouldn't stay the  same you should keep changing so I used  to think that I will always be this shy  awkward girl my username is awkward good  for the same time that's why it's  awkward yeah okay I was really awkward  but um and I had made it my entire  personality not made it but also made it  yeah so now now I've realized that I can  keep changing I don't you realize that  you're not awkward you're just a good  no I am still quite awkward like inside  I'm very awkward right now How To Lose  Friends  thank you so much for that  um I'm gonna uh  this we're inching to the close uh sorry  okay so we're at the end of this episode  uh my last question is how would you

on the gentleman show by  the man company we discuss the modern  gentleman or harvo aspect to hamari  likes  wearing makeup there are still a lot  more nuances that we all need to  understand  we have with us better non-stop which is  who is one of india's finest drag queens  hello hello uncle hi how are you i'm  great how are you thank you for having  me here it's our pleasure and i'm really  looking forward to this conversation me  too and then we have aman bhatia who is  an ace makeup content creator and i just  found out also makeup artist hi aman hi  ankush how are you i am good i am  looking forward to this so am i uh let's  start from the beginning uh better so  tell us tell our listeners what you do  who drag queens really are when did you  start what happened the journey so i am  a drag queen as ankush introduced me as  and a drag artist is essentially someone  who's creating a exaggerated character  for stage or for video or for a podcast  um uh yeah so basically it's you base uh  expressing your  wildest and most craziest imaginative  creature that you've always had in your  head oh so it could be a creature also  it can be a creature it doesn't have to  be gender specific it can it can be an  alien it can be a tree it can be an  animalistic sort of a thing okay  there's a lot like drag is huge it's  it's not just women impersonation it's  not just men dressing up as women okay  it's uh it's  anyone anyone belonging to any gender  any identity creating something creating  a tool to express themselves which they  might not  which they feel they might not be able  to do out of drag  oh all right so basically if i unders  understand this correctly  upload dress up curtis something and  that also includes like makeup is a big  part of it and then you get on stage and  then you perform for people yeah it's  like it's an art form it's an art form  right as as in like basic simple terms  it's an art form like there's theater  there's it is it is a theater hater has  had drag since like if you want to go to  the history where women were not allowed  to step out of the house and work there  were men essentially who were playing  all these right  i think drag came into my life uh it was  there in my life for a very long time  because i would always like sneak in  when nobody's home and dress up get into  my sister's closet  and so that was my week that was my  first week but i obviously i was a  little kid and i did not know that is  drag and what am i doing it was for me  it was just  fun i would play all those cheesies 90s  uh bollywood songs and play and dance up  in the living room everything like  recently have you performed some pia pia  gear from  uh and everyone's like  everyone major throwback major throwback  right so i was always also full circle  moment  i have my stage live audience pick  around so  uh yeah to drag the times  but i got to know drag drag through  rupaul's drag race the show the show the  reality show american reality show uh  usmed drag queens they come every season  they perform they compete with each  other for america's next drag superstar  and they make their own costumes they  make their own costumes yeah they set up  their own hair i also do that not just  them of course of course but like  there's so much talent oh yeah that i  mean i i saw one episode of the show and  i was like wow are these people doing  this all by themselves that's crazy  that's the best part i think because  it's also related to freedom right like  i said  expression  true but i can be a good guest lecturer  also  okay to all the teachers and people who  are handling the education system  listening you have better non-stop here  so aman what  what do you love about makeup and you  know how did you  so you started as a  makeup artist i started as an engineer  oh wow okay okay let's go back one more  step yeah yeah as an engineer yeah i did  my btec right and then i realized i need  to do something like you know i enjoy  using makeup so let's just do it on  others so usability you were doing  makeup on yourself or you were not doing  that i used to do makeup i have been  wearing makeup since i was 13. oh but it  upgraded as i grew so you learned more  yeah i learned more and more and then i  thought let's just learn it  professionally because i used to get on  instagram i used to get a lot of dms do  you do makeup and i thought okay i can  make a lot of money from this and why  not it's an avenue for you yeah so i uh  worked i did my like i did my b tech and  i did  the job related to b-tech for one year i  saved up my money and then i did course  like a makeup course and after that i  became a makeup artist i started working  for a brand also i worked with them for  a new year  and and then you decided your content  creation because no it was covered i had  nothing to do i was getting my account  my so  so i thought okay let's sit in front of  the camera and do makeup i uploaded my  first video and then i got like amazing  response yeah and slowly and after three  months like i was approached by  cosmopolitan for an article and then i  started doing that that's pretty cool  and i think all three of us would agree  make up like love for makeup or ekote  also love for the camera  yeah you know there's love for  performing they're two different things  i know a lot of people didn't make up  cannot select there but they don't  necessarily want to be on camera wearing  makeup but was that that transition from  like a makeup artist someone who works  behind the scenes to be the face of your  content was that  no it never happened actually to be  honest when i used to work with brands  also people like  when we work with the brand you have a  lot of clients coming up to you they're  always used to telling me oh my god you  have amazing lips you should have you  taken your fillers or something so every  time i used to like  maybe i'm too pretty maybe i'm too  pretty you are  you are okay maybe the world needs to  say yep they don't know and then i sat  in front of the camera and like i said  the first response was the only thing  that changed my mind no i can do this  okay and was the family supported yeah  yeah definitely oh great yeah tell us  more about that like how how did your  family come to terms with the the fact  that you know my uh parents actually  they asked me to do one thing once i  completed my video they wanted me to  work to see how it is to do job nine to  five learn the lesson of punctuality and  whatever the normal parents think and  after that they were like okay now you  have done whatever you wanted to learn  and i think you are ready for your  journey now so go ahead and do whatever  you need that's that's pretty cool no  yeah and that is really amazing i think  parents need to give their children and  i think i feel lucky that way uh yeah i  mean of course but i i really wish  for the first time i wish parents a  podcast  and you know if parents would definitely  listen this like each and every thing  even the content that i upload my heart  is like you have too much color on your  cheeks just reduce it you need to do  this eye makeup my mom comes and  everybody is like that's everybody is a  makeup artist no like they need to give  me some of the other idea every time  even when i'm uh go live on instagram my  dad comes he feeds me he's like  eye makeup looks  you need to reduce it okay i do this do  that and i like everybody is asking me  who's there who is there behind the  camera i was like my dad it's it's hard  for i'm sure it's heartwarming for so  many people out there listening to this  right now who crave that support from  family it's a message for them that you  know you never know your family might  just be more accepting than you think  they could be right yeah and  i and i feel this podcast  you know a similar story but you know  engineering  we just took on our own journey but  nobody has talked about makeup like this  so i feel that this is sending out  another message that this could also be  a a career avenue for people now right i  think makeup is all about being yourself  makeup is not about you know it's meant  for women they are only supposed to use  it's just  it should be used to make you look good  no makeup can be used by anybody  it's like very close right you you like  yeah i mean to all the men i keep saying  this key you like putting on a biker  jacket and you feel cool about it  sometimes i will drag by the way  if that person is wearing a biker jacket  for a bike ride that is drag  wow  surprise yeah  surprise person wearing a coat and tie  for his corporate job that is drag like  rupaul says you were all born naked and  the rest is drag  so basically like are you dressing up  for the podcast that's also dry oh this  is uh this is a an eye-opening moment  for like literally everyone i think  right now so thanks for saying that okay  let's address the elephant in the room  now  i know that there has been a lot of  conversation about you know men  normalizing makeup and you know breaking  stereotypes and this and that and  like i have also been told oh you are  breaking stereotypes by doing this this  that and then i spoke to a lot of my  friends from the lgbtqia plus community  and they made me understand that you  know  easily accepted  support  the truth is that so many people have  been doing this before me and the  difference between them and me is my  gender identity  privilege  gender  my ex is gender manhole  it's  and explain that why is it easier for me  so because we live in a heteronormative  society and because your cisgender the  the privilege that you mentioned that  comes with it  so if it wasn't easy for you also  nobody's nobody's diminishing your  struggle  uh you know nobody's invalidating the  hate right exactly  but it is a big achievement like  photo eyeliner pig magazine piano that  is also a big thing for a country like  india right but conversation with he and  uh  it's a little easier for someone like  you yeah or maybe maybe even for me like  maybe out of drag says who i'm okay make  with another bullying willingness  like until unless i'm like you're  dressed up and dressed up fully dressed  about wearing even like slightest bit of  makeup or  but like i was like we were just  discussing we would also love if the  same support was extended  to people who are from the lgbtqia plus  community so many non-binary people so  many trans people so many so many queer  people who do makeup but just because of  their identity uncover same support name  have you faced this in person uh yeah  just  karaoke uh you know you see so many  different faces this is definitely  refreshing  drag performances i've seen it i've seen  i've seen i've seen you and drag before  i've seen sushant interact before yeah  so for me i i had that image in mind  right so when i started doing makeup i  know that my journey started much after  so many other people so subconsciously  yes i was inspired by so many queer  icons yeah right and i'm inspired i'm  def getting inspired every day with like  every new uh drag queen that i come  across even on instagram kissing photo  they close up or make a post they go  makeup tutorial they know it is  inspiring and i think agar lok accepts  like it's okay if you don't like it you  need to learn how to mind your own  business  it's not a communicable disease  i think the biggest problem is  acceptance  i see so many men and you know when i  see somebody uh for example  with respect to like sexuality gender  everything makeup men wearing makeup a  lot of things we see around us which we  may not understand fully but it is okay  to not understand things fully but it is  more important to accept them because  everybody is an adult doing that minding  their business and if it's not harming  you then it's none of your business to  tell people what to do no exactly  definitely  you'll understand how much they say but  i don't know but how does that matter to  me i live my life i'm living my happy  life i'm surrounded by people who love  me and i don't even know about their  existence so how does that that could  also be you know because someone you are  surrounded by people who support you  there may be so many people so who may  not have that support no i just know one  thing people around me who support me  are the people who educate others as  well  because when they support me they show  that if we can support others can  support as well so i strongly believe in  this  that  you know if someone is supporting me i  am sure  you support me  and that is what i believe in  if i see something wrong is happening  and if i know that is wrong i definitely  go there and tell that person  so i think people who support me must be  like that but you know i'll tell you  what happens in like  when you're sitting in a group and  someone cracks like a homophobic joke or  a transphobic joke and even if you know  it's wrong  some people just can't get themselves to  confront it right then because  there's a stigma around it actually even  standing up even being an ally yeah  stigma that is why lgbtq a i may a some  people say asexuals but some people also  say a stands for ally because being an  ally also needs coming out there  uh aman has any of this ever made you  feel like  you're a misfit in the man community  like have men made you feel like you're  a misfit no  no you don't allow them to just because  i wear makeup so i'm not man enough  it doesn't even make sense how silly it  sounds right but has this have you  always been this wise  development it's been a journey or  you've always been like this see uh one  thing i'll always uh this is what my  father says when you are  about to do something new  you will always  come across people who will be against  you  so  if you want to do something new just be  ready for that so i was ready when i  like i said for from my first video i  was ready  um exactly that is what happened there  were negative negativity around me but  then with like aman's aman's story i  feel  you have been at the receiving end of  all of this change which i'm really  happy to see yeah it's refreshing to  hear it's really and the society the  place where i live even now just wearing  nail pins and walking from the last  building to the center the main gate of  the society in itself not just from  people from my age  it does hurt like that's exactly what i  was coming to like what is it  being in dragon being outside the stage  you know i used to take dance classes  happy society may and there were summer  vacations with chute  and then coincidentally when i started  going public with my drag  students come away and then randomly  like teen look dance  i see just to see and  i asked him  youtube videos  you know who says that i look up to you  and everything now he's like he just  because something it's something that my  lifestyle he  his family decided  and then  that  went on to you know with a  hello hi we got then hello yeah as i get  some  i would end up like literally raising my  hand without you know any thing coming  back it is embarrassing it is hurtful as  well but yeah to know that like you  to know one stage one two just embrace  who you really are and what you want to  do and then realizing that you might  just be like alone in doing that an  outcast probably yeah  uh but how do you how do you deal with  that like every day yeah yeah i mean  it is difficult i mean you said like  archaic are better than when you think  of you know what happened throughout the  day it does bring bring you down and you  know uh mudra and all but i feel i am at  a place with myself right now also  thanks to drag thanks to makeup like the  power of the confidence that i've got is  through makeup  and through drag so ab i am at that  point of my life  [Music]  and the more you and it gives me more of  a responsibility to be more loved  because screw it like  f everyone else  [Music]  whenever in my experience whenever i've  seen drag artists they  like  to make that's exaggerated makeup right  so is it kind of like  reclaiming  i'm still gonna look better than you so  because even the costumes even the wigs  everything is exaggerated and like loud  because there's a purpose behind it  i am a middle-class brown boy a punjabi  family soon but right now i'm wearing  like a pink hot pink short mini dress  with like a neon jacket and a pink wig  if that brings some picture to the  audience yeah  if makeup makes you feel uncomfortable  that's what better has dressed us  for a casual podcast  let's face it  like drag artists  this is how they earn and if they're so  discriminated against so tell us more  about life of like a drag queen and i  mean you may come from a certain sense  of privilege but i'm pretty sure that  you're also connected to so many more  people who have different stories so  tell us what are the struggles of like  if a man chooses to be a drag queen one  day and put on makeup and celebrate it  what is life like  i think number one challenge always  always stays uh society  uh because  like my if i do this  [Music]  not loud it's not short clothes it's not  it's for them  that's another thing and uh  it sometimes becomes so bad directly  performance  and that's even though there's just like  few words it just pinches you in a weird  way because that is not what you want to  yeah but that's not what you're  portraying and they're also crossing a  line like exactly with you exactly only  because they think they can with your  conditioning and your assumptions you're  coming up to me and you're saying just  three words but you don't know how  impactful they may be to someone  some people can take it in a strong way  like uh two or four [ __ ]  sometimes they say but they shouldn't  have to be that sick skinned  exactly why should anybody have that  responsibility to you know have become  that thick skin person to you know  defend themselves constantly when i'm  just at a safe space trying to be myself  right why do i have to put up a front of  you know a defense  but why  i'm asking this to the both of you why  do you think it is that men find it so  hard to accept that blood coconut  the more we talk about it the more  people listen to ss it changes  so uh  these days  like i said today  changed  but uh still like a lot of men would  associate makeup anything makeup to  women or or either  not women anything feminine feminine  right and the whole stigma around uh you  know being feminine means being weak  being a second gender or you know  being lower  lower than men yeah so the vohi stigma  as fast because makeup be women's  related  it shouldn't be around a man's and i  also feel that masculinity to a lot a  lot of extent is defined by what women  are not  exactly it's not what men are but  we are everything that women  that they just fail to  you know be themselves and i also feel  joe zadar is opposed  they are actually  fighting their own feminine energy  within themselves okay that brings me to  the next segment which is called  okay okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna ask you  guys a fun question and you just answer  it now um i'll start with amman  what if your makeup kit could tell us a  secret about you  i am sassy and [ __ ] at the same time  is that a secret sort of because [ __ ]  well aside  that's a polar supremacy oh fair enough  not everybody knows  public knowledge  but what is your uh what if your makeup  kit could tell us a secret about it  maybe that i have borderline ocd  because everything is fully arranged  even like coming down from the dressing  room before i came i had arranged  everything back very nicely you know why  i asked this because i feel people are  the most themselves and they're getting  ready  to  that is their essence as a person when  they're sitting in front of are they  stressed are they are they enjoying it  are they trying to hide something  it's in front of that vanity mirror that  you yeah find out who you really are i  feel that's why i asked this so this  brings me to the end of the podcast and  we call this the final word so i want  you better to define  the modern gentleman in one word  i think the model mo model  the modern gentleman these days would be  uh someone who's  just a little more accepting accepting  is a word yeah  accepting like any accept willing and  open to accept new things  right not be so rigid in your own values  if you are conditions  great but then be open to change break  out of it break out of it that's  beautiful aman what about you  for me it would be kind  kindness is something that we lack and  that is the reason there are so many  problems around  us so i feel if we are kind towards  others a lot of things will change a lot  of negativity will go away so i believe  in one thing giving kindness and taking  kindness in return  so if a gentleman you know a perfect  definition would be to be kind kind  okay that was beautiful that was very uh  that was a very interesting conversation  i got to learn so much more today and i  hope all the listeners also understood  what we were really talking about and i  hope that you take out the time to go  and research about these things there  may be terms that you may not have  understood fully i'm looking we touched  upon a lot of topics but it would take  forever to discuss all of these things  in detail i really hope um you go and  educate yourself after this podcast and  you've learned something from it this is  me angus

kind of like a slab to the  society  but what about  you know the head of their  [Music]  idea of beauty the society  you should look like this  [Music]  hello everyone this is ankus bahuguna  you have tuned into yet another episode  of the gentleman show by the man company  or just um  this podcast is about harvo  special guest joe uh one of my closest  friends in the content creator actor  circuit  instagram  okay  characters  is it are you today are you kim k today  are you what i'm just myself today  that's more than you can handle that's  also true that's also true  excited  one of my closest friends and uh we are  going to discuss dating today so i  thought  if shibani is the person that she is in  real life today bore the unfiltered  opinions  because  dating advice from me is like the blind  leading the blind you know because i  mean i'm single so i don't know what do  i have to offer i'm advising  opinions  we've  all through the videos that you've done  with me it felt like  so then  yeah i feel like people who recognize  though you know  um  um it's not like i'm very recognized  it's not like everybody i meet on a  dating app or in life a lot of people  will know you mildly they don't know me  too well they might have seen me some of  them actually don't or maybe they know  and they pretend like they don't you  know  right yeah but i feel like i consciously  stay away from people who seem too  attached to my  image or the life i project online  or at least in my content it's a put off  for you sometimes because you know if  you are in  awe of the persona that you've seen  then  i don't know i just feel like it's  either too much pressure to keep up with  that or that's also not that's literally  one tenth of me that's actually true you  know shibani is one of those creators  she doesn't open up a lot about the  person she is on social media and i feel  like a lot of things that i struggle  with now also a lot of people will not  enjoy it you know i can't always and i i  feel like in life  you know  that may not be very motivating for  people no and it will confuse the  audience they wouldn't know who they are  following you know if you've come to my  channel because i make you laugh when  you're having having a tough day and  then i  put nobody myself out there which is  completely cynical sometimes you know as  someone who's been  sometimes people also checking up on you  i feel like it gets a little too much it  feels like oh my god have i made a  marketing campaign  yeah you know so  i intimidate you you know that's  something that i'm not a tune to handle  and i keep telling people if you think  shibani is funny online  wait till you meet her in real life and  wait till you become her friend because  the things she will say candidly are i  think shibanigar online thus percent  like 100 funny that's just ten percent  of her asleep is way funnier and way  more entertaining or as that's why you  have to be yourself on this podcast okay  i'm good i hope i'm not too myself  because then it will reach forever you  know  that's also true but we'll control that  so  so let's get back to you your dating  life as an influencer  is it  like you said it's a put off when people  already know what you do yeah  not always sometimes sometimes it's uh  when they expect you to be that person  in reality also  the thing is  it makes sense to take time because you  know you can never be sure who you're  dealing with right even when you're  talking to somebody and they you know  everybody is all  um you know  coffee hot tub coffee makeup version  premium proper version of themselves  obviously you put your best foot forward  yeah and even when you're talking to  people  who you're dealing with till you get on  a call with them until you do uh you  know  process  let's start from step one like you find  people on dating apps yeah not really  offline also offline also through  contacts through contacts  come  come come home  i  if the conversation is interesting you  know if the things they say or  what i feel they are saying  if it catches my attention then i chat  with that does hate you catch it and  hide here  does it catch your attention beautiful  pics  beautiful picks they just say hey dear  uh please please wish us happy birthday  oh no which is sweet yeah anyway huh no  the hair they are beautiful pics though  i don't match only with because it's  like  okay  you know and some people though i think  who know me also hey dear we have  beautiful eyes i think i've seen you  somewhere you  connect with me to know me better and  i'm like why  i mean you know sometimes it's just  i can't express it i know it sounds very  maybe shallow sometimes the basis on  which you decide  sort of like i know what to expect what  this person will be like okay  but again you can never be sure you know  because um sometimes i feel like  i also end up dismissing people on  things which maybe in the long run are  not red flags you know  but like with you there is a lot of give  and take there are a lot of people who  like like offloading suck your energy  out don't give you space to speak and  then they're like oh you're a great  listener and i'm like yeah because you  didn't give me a choice  so mother joey i'm just giving an  example i feel like um  it  i take time to sort of assess a person  it's easy for me to assess a person and  then decide if i want to talk or not and  then depending on the conversation  i try getting on a you know  a facetime call or a video call a video  call  okay stop saying sorry  you you do a video call and you assess  the person yeah and then yeah i feel  like i've also kind of sometimes been  lucky that there are people who are  patient who are also not looking to jump  into things  and then there have been times when i've  either gotten on a phone call or a video  call with someone and they've literally  like  sucked the life out of me or just have  turned out to be a complete anti-thesis  of the person they were projecting and  i'll be honest i haven't  delved into online dating very  aggressively i've had two three bad  experiences in the last two three years  and after that i was like boss this is a  cesspool like and especially during the  pandemic you know like there'd be a lot  of people who plan okay video video call  currently  show  i've matched with people been talking to  them exchanging numbers with them or  whatever and they've turned out to be  okay  and uh the next thing i know is they're  actually just engaged  while doing this you know on the side on  absolutely  then like do you like to go out on dates  or do you like to go to their place or  call them go out on dates and i prefer  my first date to be very kosher in the  sense like no alcohol  at a time which is not  late in the night it's a meeting then  yeah but of course it's actually a very  healthy way to go about things you know  in therapy i've learned that you know  every time you're with somebody observe  your body observe how your body is  responding to them and not  sexually you know not attraction-wise  but just the ease  you feel around them dating  problem  yes  you don't catch on to everything when  you foundationally don't know what to  look for i realized four things are  non-negotiable you need to be with  somebody and you need to assess whether  a person and their presence makes you  feel safe makes you feel hurt makes you  feel seen and makes you feel valued  and if these things work  everything else can be worked around  obviously even attractions  which brings me to the friend zone thing  you know sometimes friend zone is you  not feeling sexual chemistry towards  somebody now just because romantic  chemistry yeah you know and just because  some guy or a girl is nice to you and  you don't want to go have sex with them  does that mean that you're doing  something wrong you're just asserting  you're  right  i am playing the devil's advocate here  only for the sake of this conversation  so you know it's a common thank you  friendzone  you  you talk to a girl yeah and then things  are going great and you feel that the  girl is interested in you right now and  mokka the key tells you  i'm not i'm i i i love you but as a  friend and not as you know someone  romantic so this is something that a lot  of men feel betrayed by hmm  can't i or can't you as a guy also take  your time to decide whether you want to  or whether you see yourself with a  person sexually or not even if i have  let's say had sex with a guy and then i  feel like yeah may i can't sign up this  is not working for me i didn't enjoy the  sex so i i don't know i don't see myself  with this person but this is a good  person to have in your life so i still  want this person but on not in the  capacity of like a boyfriend  and not just after you know  slightly dating them but also maybe  before you end up let's say if you meet  somebody with the intention of dating  and on the date or whatever you decide  or yeah you realize  through multiple dates or on the first  date you know  attraction your sexual energy legally  but i feel like i have gate great  chemistry  so is it  like there are a lot of boys who also  complain they reject us and friends own  us because we are nice  is the medal does the medal start with  the girl's vagina or the rights to [ __ ]  her or even for women like does the  metal  parliamentary language please  because sometimes friend zone is  actually a great place to be you know  it's it's a sustainable place to be it  means that you are valued as a person  but  somewhere the other person also  understands that their body is not  responding to you very sexually and in  case things happen in the future great  but  why  [Music]  so as a woman what do you have to say to  that  like what do women want yeah i feel like  the problem is women from the start are  not encouraged to express discomfort  very blatantly  like you are  trained to be somebody something before  you're trained to be a woman of your own  worth you know  so i feel like it's it's  be please be forgiving towards women  because sometimes they don't allow  themselves the liberty to  express their discomfort  which makes it difficult for them people  who want to care for them or who want to  satisfy their needs to also be available  what is that about i feel like maybe  that's just women keeping themselves  or that that's just their own internal  innovation from expressing what they are  going through or is it an individual  thinking some people just could be as i  said of course it's mostly individual  but i think largely i i don't know i  mean i i in my opinion like i i can't  speak for everybody else but i think  largely it's just  sometimes not thinking that what you say  will be catered to or will be taken  seriously or  is even worth expressing you know i i  don't know have you ever to today  so then you quickly say something else  which is yeah i mean in the sense he was  staged  you know i feel like that level of  self-consciousness maybe 10 years ago  yeah there could have been moments where  i was but that's what i yeah my problem  is i've spent a chunk of my life being a  doormat and i've spent a chunk of my  life maybe there's your point no the  being the person that you mentioned you  know the mixed signal type joe express  [ __ ] keep prioritizing and keep making  themselves invisible to make sure there  is enough room for the person they are  with so much okay  so anyway what i was saying is i feel  like sometimes you  so you know and then obviously that  becomes room for them dumping you or  things just going south because you know  suddenly you are asking for something  that they never knew they were meant to  sign up for you're also dating people  who don't care about you because if they  did they wouldn't have allowed you to  become invisible you know so i feel like  now consciously i feel like through the  course of a lot of bad experiences and  therapeutics  i've realized that you know  um  only express yourself you know like it's  it it makes sense to set the right  foundation you know when you go on dates  [Music]  so i've seen so many i've seen so many  women also who are so confident about  what they want they just know what they  want right  secondly  but i i do believe that you know i i  feel like a lot of indecisiveness in  women  again you know this is just a conjecture  it's a layer it's a layer it's also just  again it comes down to the same thing  where you are not  conditioned to you're not trained to  definitely want and express  you know  you know at a restaurant  you know but  but that also takes time and effort it  depends on how confident with your body  you are to be able to you know with that  except  perspective  you know because the consequences of  this conditioning i've paid a huge price  for it i think all my life  and as i said you know i keep saying  please take therapy the whole world  should go to a therapist at some point  and make sure it's a good one who cares  about you who is invested in you it  helps you unravel and figure out a lot  of things about you  red flags red flags red flags  what are the red flags for you and like  women in general that you know i know  that you can't talk for everyone  obviously but what are the common red  flags that women  look for in a  look for me but like  beware of  very off in a guy yeah they go up i've  realized you can never be sure of who  you're with and what red flags are till  you are with them  and sometimes a lot of people's  personality flaws  and issues pop up  they can pop up at any given stage of  their life  but ha matlab  the three four things that you need to  look out for three four siblings  actually  how you how safe do you feel around that  person  in the initial  how  they treat you how are how respectful  are they of your boundaries in your life  how they talk about women in general  should be a huge marker  are they the believers or propagators of  not like other girls school of thought  what is that it's like  why is it problematic to say that dude  it's like you know it's love bombing in  a way somewhere where you are  unnecessarily  making the person feel like  yeah it's kind of misogynistic and  borderline love bombing like  you know like you're putting that thing  so if at any point if the girl starts  behaving like other girls  she'll fall from grace and that'll give  him enough reason to either dump her or  constantly tell her that you've changed  and you know like pull her up for it and  [ __ ] like that i feel like this  narrative is and it's very misogynistic  what is other girls  what is unlike other girls everybody  every girl is  like other girls we are all together you  know and and women are all there's no  one way to be a girl yeah you know and  secondly women are also sold this  narrative and pitted against each other  because this is just basically  internalized  yeah because other guys are painted as  um  you know abusive  strangely all boys are also like other  boys only you know love everybody there  are a certain set of entitlement and  flaws that i think men in general even  the non cis-hat  ones have and i've noticed this even in  some in some of my you know  gay friends with their conditioning just  the ha just the gender  role conditioning that i think they've  faced  and the way patriarchy works from the  day you're born you know even if your  mother or your father didn't consciously  raise you to look at  gender and women and men a certain way  the way they also behave the way the  world functions yeah is is internalized  conditioning at some levels  you don't live your life out at home you  don't grow up at home all the time you  know your peers the whole world comes  into play when it comes to a child  absorbing and growing yeah the first two  thousand or three thousand days of their  lives are not just spent with mummy papa  you know they are spent with everyone  they have access to so yeah subscribe  and if you still have those problems in  you and vulnerabilities they can be used  against you  why not  okay so you tell me uh  very interesting question  are you ready for it oh my god does size  matter  i don't know  [Music]  um  maybe for some people i'm sure it does  but i don't think size matters if you  are a shitty person  and don't know how to respect  your partner and treat them well and are  unaccountable and unreliable  from sustainable relations  with  so in that sense ice doesn't always  matter because you know sometimes sex  and what your penis makes a woman feel  is not the only thing that they care  about in the long run another thing that  i want to talk about and muzu path asked  their opinion but i want to address it  publicly right the bill splitting on  dates it's a whole conversation  you know like um  when you go out on a girl  go out on a date with a girl you always  pay the bill because that's what nice  gentlemen do  and then um a lot of men also feel keep  you there  i see i'm slightly old school and i sort  of believe in chivalry a little bit and  if you've asked someone out  then try footing it but if the girls and  sisters  plead split split then split it you know  no but my point is key again the other  argument  if you can afford it there's no pressure  and i don't think  i don't know if it's you i mean i know a  lot of women who hold it against men who  make them split the bill on the first  date especially but a lot of but a lot  of women also don't like it when the man  pays because they feel that key yeah  yeah i can pay for myself yeah so  depending on the vibe  you know i feel like but then how do men  decide  okay you know uh yeah this time you  should always propose to pay the bills  for the first  why should one person see my logic is  very simple two people are going on a  dinner if both of you are earning yeah i  feel like somewhere it's a chivalrous  thing to do so is it do you think do you  think chivalry is still relevant in  today's day and age or do you think that  it's uh because there's another  conversation that chivalry in itself is  slightly sexist because you always  consider that women can't take care of  themselves so you need to take care of  them yeah so  i mean i  do sometimes feel like chivalry is also  a sign of good manners sometimes you  know and i i don't mind it personally  you know and i frankly also don't care  about it i genuinely don't so would you  judge if a guy asked you to split the  bill  no  i mean  unless that guy has asked me out and  told me i want to take you over  here  then  i always offer to pay the bill and i am  okay sharing it and there are also times  when if a guy has taken or put like  one dinner or drink session  then i make sure the next time i take it  you know i  that's just but that's just me you know  so i feel like i  like chivalry so i work around it so  that the person in question doesn't feel  like  a princess  so you compensate in other ways yeah but  i feel like it is it totally depends on  where you are financially  and where you  want to draw the line and depending i  don't know  this is not just dates it's friends also  this is that's crazy friends never no no  i'm saying i'm saying that my logic is  this is my personal opinion that  i mean uh  even when you're going out with friends  whatever whenever you're going out with  someone and you're both capable of  paying the bill  then just split it like there are other  ways  there are 100 other ways of showing  affection yeah  like you said like you said there are  100 other ways of showing equality yeah  mera my logic is not key equality says  bill split karaoke but i'm saying that  your respect for the other person can  also be shown in a million other ways  yeah it doesn't have to be money related  yeah but i feel like maybe sometimes  it at least initially in the initial  days of courting i guess so then would  you if you ask a guy out and if you say  let's go for dinner would you pay the  bill then why not but the thing is  i  um yeah i mean see ayato would pay the  bill  uh even if the guy has asked me out you  know like  it's not but yeah sometimes i do find it  odd when somebody is insisted to take  you out for something while you've not  been very very keen  and then suddenly it becomes a match of  equality because you know it's like some  friends maybe the kartha like when you  are very keen on meeting a friend you  tell the friend okay i'll take you out  i'll take you out but i'll tell you the  difference that the difference between  friends is key you know that you're  going to meet these friends again so  there will be more opportunities you  know what i mean don't you maybe it's a  way to i don't know show respect for  somebody's time i'm just saying i mean  it there are various narratives it's a  very it's a great one also so that okay  so then you're saying that different  women have different opinions yeah and i  feel like all of them are fine and you  should also judge the situation played  by the year and see  what is uh modern dating for people who  are not into casual sex  tough yeah i mean really you know i have  realized ankur sometimes um by by this  question i mean that in a world where  you know like we've all we all know that  casual sex is a thing now it's  normalized which it should be  um  there are situation ships there's like  it's not old school dating anymore but  there are some people who believe in old  school data then i feel like  your intention  and how you communicate it should be  very very clear but is it difficult for  an old school person  to find someone in today's day and age  but then there's a possibility that if  they don't see themselves getting  married or settling down so soon  they will find a way out of it i feel  like largely honestly speaking  um  in your early twenties and all now it's  a little harder to find people  especially  when you're looking for men you know  who who in the same age bracket who  will consciously slug it out unless  that's also something that they want i  feel like deep down everybody wants the  same thing you know either the label of  marriage or not but everybody wants to  be with somebody yeah you know we are  all ultimately looking for that  unless you are  an unreliable person and those people  also find a lot of takers but a lot of  like some people may not care about the  the duration of the relation they might  just be looking for like casual sex  rules and agendas  don't you know like plod along with a  man  pandering to what he needs and his want  for no labels  while you want a label  if the guy wants to be serious but the  girl is only looking for something yeah  and then you know dump that girl or dump  that boy for doing that because they  will never change they will never come  around  you can't change their mind are you  saying that you know if they don't if  there is you know i there's this one  quote by this guy mark manson you know  where he says if it isn't a yes it's a  no  if somebody is not sure about you means  that they are not sure about you  foreign  [Music]  when we  foreign  [Music]  okay this is a very problematic  i know right  now say it like you would but hey  problematic character  she's every buwaji you're dating advice  for men i frankly don't know  be yourself guys  and maybe be a little less asshole-ish  and uh you know it's okay to learn how  to not be sexist and challenge your  conditioning it's possible it's it's  it's okay to do that it doesn't it is  not a threat to your masculinity or it's  a question to your masculinity  final question  uh define the modern gentleman in one  word huh  conflicted conflicted don't you think so  what is the explain  i feel like nobody wants to be a  you know a big r person  [Music]  of  knowing and not knowing and conditioning  is  is too much  and then to move around in a setup where  things are very different but you are  raised with values which are very like  set in stone i think conflict is such a  great way to describe it because like  you said the conditioning even if you  want to learn better yeah  you've been taught a certain way so it  takes time to yeah unlearn that and that  teaching is very convenient it makes  life very easy for patriarchy  makes life easy for men sometimes  a lot of times yeah of course and i also  think that your privilege  give  yeah because you know  if you want to keep somebody around who  is their own person a woman especially  uh you know you'll work around what she  needs and sometimes that can be tough  and challenging and that's why there is  conflict very beautiful thank you so  much shibani okay so that was the end of  this episode uh this is

The Man Company,The Gentleman Show | EP 04 | What's Your Gender? | Nitasha Biswas | @arnabpapu | @ankushbahuguna,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqgzL4OntYk,we are very different and we're both men  but his idea of being a man is this sony  so what  [Music]  so it's kind of like a slab to the  society  but what about  you know the head of their  idea of beauty the society  like this  [Music]  hello everyone this is ankus bhagna and  you have tuned into yet another episode  of the gentleman show by the man company  aspect discussion  acceptance of people who we may not  necessarily  the conversation has changed and we need  to keep up with it and you know the  owners of learning is on all of us right  we have natasha who is india's first  trans woman to win a beauty pageant  and we have arnab viswas who identifies  as a gay man and also works on diversity  and inclusion at his workplace hello  both of you how are you  how are you i'm good i'm good  i am good i'm good i'm just thinking  conversation body intention  and i'm just  and i just want to say start this by  saying that if i mess it up if i mess  something up if i say something wrong if  i use the wrong terms please feel free  to correct me because i feel um it's  just very  important to uh give out the right  information and opinions about this  particular topic and um to all my  listeners i want to say i know your  topic to maybe what heavy  but  i feel that it's high time that we talk  about these things quite openly and um  i'm pretty sure that everything that is  said on today's podcast is going to be a  learning for someone or the other yep  okay so i'm going to start with you know  full form with the lgbtqia plus  which is like a blanket term for a whole  community which is like a wide spectrum  of gender and identities and sexuality  and whatnot so lgbtqia plus stands for  lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer  intersex and ally and there's a plus  because  i think the plus is there because um  you know  till date we have come so far with so  many genders at the moment and the  different um  virtues of being born in this world  right so i think it's going to be more  than plus so i think what's your  pleasure would  it's more about you know you we want to  cover everyone because there might be  people who do not identify as  one of them and any of these  existence is still valid of course so  that's the reason and we are unaware  about it so that's the reason we you  know want to cover everyone and be more  inclusive and that's the plus  basic questions  because i feel that  we get  like they've heard transgender but they  don't know what cisgender is yeah so up  uh can one of you or both of you define  for me  cisgender transgender  what is intersex what is cross-dressing  let's just you know clear them first  before answering this question it's very  important to know that what is sex at  birth  what is gender and what is sexual  orientation so let's start with that sex  or gender make africa sex i mean sex is  good and gender  wow okay  gender is uh you know i am born uh i'm  assigned male at birth but then i don't  think from my heart and mind that i'm a  i'm a guy okay so then i am identify i  identify myself as a as a as something  different than my assigned than my uh  sex at birth  someone is born male assigned male 1  i'll tell you my example i'm i'm born  with sex at my sex at birth is male so  is mine yeah yeah i i identify from my  mind and heart as a male so i'm a  cisgendered man  okay so i am also cisgendered man so if  you if you were born to all my listeners  i'm just explaining if you are  assigned  male at birth and you also identify as a  man then you're cisgender yours is  gendered and now sexual orientation is a  very different thing now as a man i am  attracted towards another man  then it's i'm gay and that's got nothing  to do with your gender that's not got  nothing to do with this other two you  know uh fields which i've explained so  but you know i would not say that i'm  100 correct because it's a very very  difficult and complicated topic so i  think there are always difference in  opinions and we are we should be able to  accept those opinions i'm saying that  gay people  can also be cisgender  yep i'm a cisgendered gay man right  understood okay and natasha tell us  about  the difference between like  transgenders and cisgenders  so like what happened was um when i was  born so i was assigned male and birth  but um as with time i grew i decided  that um i wasn't i was not in the right  body so i want to change i want to  change my  you know what i was assigned at birth i  wanted to be a female i want to be a  woman so i underwent transition and i  underwent my surgeries and everything to  be called as a woman at this point of  time so what happens over here is that  um  i've transitioned to be a woman and when  i talk about the cisgender women is  someone who is assigned female at birth  or women at birth so that is exactly the  difference over here  so in in simpler terms like uh  transgender people are people who are  assigned one thing at birth right but  they identify something  gender right the one they have so then  do they have to undergo surgery to be  trans  not necessarily i think it's a very  great question because um you know bob  to my belief that i wanted it so it's my  free will to do it so someone there like  there might be a lot of other twins  women who do not want to do it so it's i  think it's a free will also  accessibility  definitely  yeah it is expensive right i wish it's  covered by the government someday  whenever actually  questions so cross-dresser or  transgender mecha  so you know let me put it like this when  i started my transition  that was back in 2015 long time ago so  what happens over there is there was a  phase in my life where i went to my  psychologist i went to my psychiatrist  because it was necessary to have these  two people the signing before my  surgeries happen because they undergo  rigorous um evaluation to understand  what they are they really wanting to  be of the opposite gender right so  whatever what happens over here is um i  had to cross this for a while to  understand how it feels to wear a bra  how it feels to wear a panty i'm just  going a little bit more inner so people  understand how does it feel when i wear  a dress so over here  i feel good so that is exactly i was  given that green signal that yes you can  go ahead and have your surgery right so  when it comes to cross-dresser a person  doesn't necessarily have to  have i mean have a surgery undergone  why because you know the person is happy  as what the expression they are showing  so again over here then comes the  non-binary  there's a lot of it's like a chain  enough like incan link we've talked  about men we've talked about women we've  talked about trans people there is like  there are non-binary people there are  gender fluid people also right joe who  don't so can you explain what gender  fluid people and non-binary  so people believe see  we have always lived in a world where  everything is defined by binary a male  and a female and one yeah so those are  the two digits right so it is high time  we understand that there can be  different uh you know kinds of people  within that spectrum of zero and one  some defined some undefined some yet to  be defined  and that's where non-binary comes  non-binary means it's a non-zero or a  non-one it can be 0.1 it can be 0.4 so  how much you know towards male or  towards female you know those two  binaries i feel like so they don't  necessarily identify as either basis  either way then also i know one  particular one but suppose i'm dressed i  feel like a man today it might happen  that tomorrow i feel like a woman so i  don't define it you know  regularly but then that's how i feel i  can't help it so those are non-binaries  okay and it's  it is none of your business what another  person identifies  one point i always make angus is that uh  whenever you are you know trying to  break out of the rule you become an  exception and an exception always stands  out  so no one wants to be an exception in a  given point of time if someone is trying  hard to become an exception out of uh  the in spite of facing all the ridicule  and you know the hap you know all the  fun being made at that means just  imagine how strongly that person  believes that this is what i want  exactly  i think that's where you know i can i  should put a word here because um  how badly i needed that right and how  badly i needed that body because  the feeling is euphoria when you have  undergone your  journey i would say and  i mean i would love to share it here  when i saw my body first time in the  mirror  without i think skin is the best cloth  in on our bodies so  it feels euphoria  and that is exactly he just put it in  his voice  but okay so natasha i want to talk to  you about this whole journey and if you  don't mind sharing with us because i  feel that  it may inspire people listening to this  it may also  make more people understand what it is  really like to be trans and growing up  trans right right because i'm pretty  sure that  things were difficult before you  realized you know what being trans is so  can we start from the beginning can you  tell us about your story so like um like  i come from calcutta i was in a all boys  school in synthesis calcutta so  of course bullying has been a part of my  life  since um i was little feminine when i  was a boy when i was a young boy so  it's like  you know like those visions coming right  now so it's like um you know fighting  yourself every day when you go to school  and you get to meet your class friends  and  i remember staying alone from the rest  of the boys because i would just not go  out and play football cricket on all the  physical activities that guys would tend  to do during that time remember i'm  talking about 2015 now long time back so  then what happens over here is um  so like growing in that atmosphere  being called names and you know certain  way to behave then you go back home then  i think my only friends were my servants  in the house when i was young right so  since my father's father was an ice  officer i was staying in a huge house  and everything so i couldn't gel  with my other neighbors but the boys  were there so  it was tough but did you always know  that you're trans or it took a while a  woman i would say i always knew i was a  woman okay so deep down within me so i  think that is exactly i  knew from then  at what age what age was this i um  i remember going through a lot of  journeys that time when the first  internet dropped in into calcutta so my  father got the internet so we had  computer classes  and my elder brother who was in the same  school so he told him that you know i  think this is what i represent i feel  like i remember my brother giving me a  porn cd in class sevens class ten or  nine i might be wrong he said you should  see the chemistry between a male and a  female  that time and i was like okay i'm the  female right he literally switched it on  and said i'm going to go to the other  room and see what happens so maybe this  is a phase he told me it's a phase in  your life that eventually like the women  body i said no i don't want to you're  just forcing me to  do something that i don't want to right  and that's wrong and at that time to  reach i knew that so i think it was in  class seven when i started this  but did you know when people react like  that did it make you question yourself  did it make you  feel like  there's something not uh you know you're  different from other people well  definitely you know imagine um when a  child goes to school  and uh you've been boycotted not been  spoken to because of your behavior  called names like [ __ ] and everything  i think that breaks the spirit of the  child it breathes because the child  doesn't know right until you tell them  so it made me believe that i'm different  which i was not  you know so it made me believe that okay  i'm different because this is how the  world thinks about me so yeah that i  think it was tough  i would definitely say it was tough  enough is in  very deep thought right now do you  yeah are you thinking about your  experiences yeah because she's talking  about 2015 i came way back because i'm  much older to other people so over here  so  when i came out i mean i would if i talk  about my journey i think uh  my father expired when i was a little  kid and i was born and brought up you  know i was brought up by my sister and  my mother it was always the female  members who was surrounding me  so  many times uh it has been told that you  are gay because you were always  surrounded by women and as you mentioned  i've also heard  you know if you have a lot of female  energy around you so you know so it it  makes me  question their education because if a  girl is being surrounded by a lot of men  would he become a boy so that's my i  mean you know you know what i mean i  mean so you can't become yeah you can't  become this is not something which i  have chosen this is what i am  so and uh as she mentioned that i was  also not much interested in sports while  my cousins and all my friends were busy  you know playing table tennis and  football and cricket i was i was very  happy and comfortable with playing with  dolls but then  their rules were my i come from a very  orthodox bengali family so they're like  oh oh why is he not playing qriket he  should be you know he should be  going there learn character and all that  but slowly and steadily i realized you  know that uh i am different and i'm okay  with my difference  so when you are confident about yourself  when you self-accept yourself then what  the third person is thinking about me  doesn't make any difference so that gave  me a lot of confidence and also  my first boyfriend whom i met in college  that person made me realize that i'm not  the only one because i didn't have  internet access then  so when i saw that okay there can be  people like me i was already  self-accepted myself then i saw a third  person and you were like okay you're  huge was i'm like like both of you said  you talked about being effeminate as a  child right so did uh arnab and that's  that was your journey to realizing that  you're gay but there may be so many gay  people who may not be effeminate as kids  right  for sure i mean  this is not a formula there's no see  over the years we have uh we have marked  that okay pink is for women blue is for  men we have gender we have given gender  to everything possible  we have given characteristics to  everything so these are all social  constructs  i was asking my sister she has equal  potential like me that why have you  never you know  done something else why have you always  been a school teacher because she's like  you know we have been blown up in a way  brought up in a way that no longer  school teachers  scope  a few professions that were accepted  yeah so which is ridiculous but then  yeah right  so coming back to you  then  where did you go from there when you  realized that okay you're a woman  but did the world around you believe  that just because you believe that  well um i remember coming out to my  elder brother first and um  i would just not come out to my brother  to my father because he was very strict  sorry one second i want to cut you there  and ask you one more question did you  have any  did you know of any um people from the  community at that age or did you have  any role models in your family or  someone who trained i mean not from  their family but then uh as i said in  class seven when i had access to  internet i started googling uh different  transgender people and the first one  came was miriam rivera so i think she  was killed or something later on i got  to know but then a lot of other girls  like um there's news that i would like  to say that uh carolyn cossey was one of  the first transgender james bond girl in  back in 90s so a lot of people doesn't  even know about it  right so i started following these  people's journey read about them i can't  imagine having nobody  to talk to about this when you're  realizing such a big truth about  yourself oh yes and depending on just  the internet all by yourself that must  have been  yeah so like you know like of course my  internet one my computer was my friend  so i used to come and um  understand and you know try to get  things out you know in my mind and  everything so i used to like you know  process it in my head  and then finally tell my brother in  class 8 i remember and  one find i just say the spawn series of  no use because you know you're just  trying to put me in a box which i don't  want to and then um  so i knew like my father would be  totally against it since um i like our  numbers you know he lost his father i  lost my mother when i was in class six  so you know like um so i was in a very  strict vigilance by my father as a mom  and a dad both  so then i was was he supportive of this  he i mean eventually i would say he was  but initially no because he would just  scare me that you cannot do this and all  um it was totally against it  but i found my way to leave the city and  come and start it you left the city yeah  i left after my schooling  because i in class 12 i had to finish  three years since he was for 12 years  and  my father was you're going to davis  college and i'm like no i'm not going  because i have to stay back back in  calcutta under his vigilance  so  i had to just leave right so i started  applying for fashion colleges and he  made me sit for  clart exam eyes exam because he's a nice  person he's like you have to sit for all  these exams and i did sit for them and  um i just tick mark whatever i wanted  because i didn't want it to pass  was switching cities was this one reason  that you could not live your life  definitely yes my relatives were not  that friendly as well because they also  had been not great towards my family so  my father had to see a lot because of my  behavior like imagine in back in  calcutta we have this ritual um i'm sure  that you know when we have saraswati  puja we all cousins come together and  then we're having durga puja in my house  from 10 15 years by then  and my cousins would not be like that  friendly with me  so i would be like oh my god like it's  so bad right  it must have been very very hard yeah  even for you ernab like growing up  because  i'm guessing now your mother is very  supportive of it but i mean  right now everyone in the family is very  supportive including my cousins uh  probably ankush i would say uh because  it was way long back  i uh i generally don't blame them  because they were not aware  but because they were not aware i  i can't really say that i was not  tormented i was tormented because i the  problems that she just mentioned i have  faced similar problems and similar  issues in my life that you know uh why  are you dressing up like a girl why do  you want to wear a bindi  and at that point when i was in class  two and three i didn't know that okay  i'm not supposed to do it  i remember days where i was crying alone  and i could not even explain it to my  mother that you know why i was crying  because  i would be very ashamed i remember one  instance in my school i was in class  eight  my biology teacher asked me what is your  gender  she was making fun of me in front of the  entire teacher a teacher a biology  teacher  had it been possible i would have told  her name as well but then  because i named those evils yeah but  yeah yeah  but that incident was so scary for me  with 66 other because i remember there  were 67  students in the class  and others all other 66 people laughing  at must have been humiliating it was  very humiliating i don't remember what i  have done to  ask me that question and i might my  question right now would have been how  dare you and it was obviously done to  shame you and not to shame me it was not  a genuine question and  you won't believe me she was one of  those teachers in school whom everyone  would look up to she was dressed up very  smartly and you know she was one of  those fancy teachers i would say and she  asked me this question but till date  that incident is there in my fresh in my  mind yeah do you ever get like for  example i was also bullied as a child  and i feel that now i have overcome all  of that but one mention of these  incidents and they're very fresh in my  memory yeah so is it the same i'm sure  it was well um since our numbers  mentioned biology teacher i mean let's  not name these evil spirits you know  first of all so good for them actually  right now  right now yeah so you know what happened  over here was uh i had a teacher who  would imitate me in front of my 50 other  art students  so when that time i was in class 10  my icsc was on the way so  i remembered i think it was a maths  class or  yeah it was let's um let's not get into  too much of details as well so the  teacher comes and i mean i as a normal  student i would just say that i had a  question for  a certain number you know for like for a  certain subject right the syllabus so  then uh like he would imitate me  so you know i mean that's like and the  entire class would laugh  imagine teachers doing this they're  supposed to teach you and they're  supposed to be good role models  wow so the enter class would laugh and  you imagine that the teacher is there  for 40 45 minutes and teaching and he's  gone so what i'm going through the rest  of the day from 9 a.m to 3 p.m so you  know they would just um  you know they would do the same thing  because you know teachers are supposed  to be teaching students so if you're  teaching this to bully others you're  adding on fool to fire so that is  exactly  transphobia homophobia it's not deep  probably those teachers didn't realize  what they were doing no probably that  same teacher would behave completely  differently right now because i'm sure  she's a well-read woman and she wouldn't  evolved she has evolved so in my case i  most of the times you know uh pardon a  lot of people thinking that okay it was  way too back but that teacher i could  not pardon honestly  for example  now your parents are supportive are your  parents supportive yeah i think the  tables turned for me after i uh when my  father saw the first article in calcutta  news that i was the first kolkata trans  woman to win a beauty pageant so that is  where my turning point happened  so my father would um i remember not  speaking to him for quite a long time  because for him it was very hard to  understand that  um you know his son is a she now right  so  he tried all his best so  when you transitioned do you remember  the day when after the transition you  met your parents oh yes yes so i think  um the best part of my life was when um  when i won the pageant in 2017 and once  again for all the listeners transition  meaning that you underwent a surgery  surgery to call myself a woman okay i'm  just like like a physical surgery a  physical cemetery okay so you know buzz  what happened was when i went back to  calcutta so what happened was um  i met him right my father so for the  first time in human flesh he saw me like  that and  i met all his um  his colleagues  and the most shocking people  yes i met all his colleagues and they  kind of you know like inaugurated me  with the flowers because i made my  father proud right and there were other  ice officers high police officers and  everything and out of which one i used  to call g2 when i was young like g2 uh  in bengali we say that so  he comes and he was crying okay i think  he was not drunk then so you know he was  not drunken  he was he was crying and holding my hand  and his wife was there auntie was there  so it was only my hand i said uncle why  are you crying and then  he says then you know what natasha when  i was young  you can imagine when i was young he's  like plus 60 right  i kind of um  wore my mom's  my sister's frock  and my father would come and beat me up  beat my [ __ ] out of me that evening  right so  seeing you i realized that  what you have changed in our minds  so i think that gave me a lot of courage  and that's impact that's a huge impact  and i was i had to use in my eyes and i  was i'm getting goosebumps right now  because i think that incident was very  touchy in my in my mind that time i just  want to say i'm very very proud of you  yeah thank you honor i think one small  uh you know point which i want to make  crying  do you not think that sometimes i'm not  defending people but i'm just saying  sometimes sympathizing may be a way of  them showing support or is that not how  you're supposed to i think you should  show support we are talking about  equality no one wants normalizing and  normalizing the more you will sympathize  the bigger the problem becomes because  it's always you're always looked in a  different  look with a different special place  are you saying that if you tell someone  that if you come out to someone or if  you tell them your story  what is an appropriate response is there  any i mean i mean  depends also uh generally i would not  tell my story to everyone for i can give  you a small incident which happened  yesterday after podcast  i mean but then uh  i came out to a colleague like very very  uh you know  normally without any without much hustle  and but he didn't react and that's  exactly the reaction we want he didn't  react he didn't say anything but i was  thinking  you're so used to being giving you  some big thing has happened oh my god  it's fine to just have uh being gay is  okay  it's you know that you know so i was  talking to this uh trans person once and  she told me that  according to her it's very personal  that's what she said she said it's very  personal but i like the reactions where  there is no reaction  because that's the only time where i  feel like what i look like what my  identity is not a point of conversation  i tell people something they they're  like okay cool  and yeah that's normal that's  normalizing it in the real estate  absolutely according to her the younger  generation  they don't they care i mean most of them  the the i would i would actually not say  the younger generation in in total  because obviously we're talking about us  we are talking about a certain section  of the society  educated aware of you know social media  exposure exposure lives in metro cities  those those handful of people they don't  react  but is this the same uh you know  condition all over india all over rural  india i'm not sure i'm not sure of  course  i get on uh you know social media every  day  by putting up very simple stuff people  you know come back saying that you know  you are great you are a hero i said i  don't think i have done something  supernatural but those things trigger  you know those things make a huge impact  in their life but imagine  when like it's so interesting that you  said  supernatural thought but interesting you  embracing yourself  is seen as an act of heroism because  that's the right that's where we are  right i'm just being me  and that is supposed to be a statement  in itself because most people are not  allowed to be there right right  like  as much as i'm proud of you i also feel  um  people are not allowed to be themselves  yeah i mean many people call me  privileged for that i think we are  privileged but  how we best utilize that privilege is  also something in our hand i mean i can  give you a small example which one  activity we did in our office so just to  give context arnab uh  just company manufacture he uh does a  lot of work for the community yeah yeah  what do you do about total background so  i work in finance but then i also uh you  know lead the lgbti wing in my company  so  that way uh we have done a lot for  social inclusion of uh the community uh  but then in as a part of the activities  on push i would just uh just tell you a  small example uh we asked people to wear  nail polish on their you know one of the  fingers and ask them to hide throughout  the day  most of ninety percent of the people  came back with a horrified experience  that i can't hide my finger  imagine a gay person hiding his own self  throughout her or his life how difficult  it can be  you can't hide one finger i'm hiding  myself all over you know every every  time i come out  wow  i think they'll understand how it how  does it feel it's a great maybe a  fraction maybe a fraction i mean just  paint one of the fingers and then i ask  you to hide don't show this finger to  anyone throughout the day come back to  me and tell me how you feel tomorrow  running into their running into your own  shoes i really hope all the listeners  listening to this right now  well i think um  definitely yes thinking  it's a mixed feeling why because um i  think of course  little bit change has been  visible but then we are not 100 yet  could we have had this conversation if  it was not decriminalized  [Music]  you could not even openly i think see  being gay was never uh  was never a criminal act uh i mean  having uh being caught in a being caught  in a sexual position with a person of  same i mean same uh you know orientation  or same gender i mean not the right term  same sex same sex that was uh not legal  okay but then again we had other laws  joe  those were very complicated natasha what  do you have to say about this i think  have you decided yes or no of course i  mean little as i said i think i  mentioned you like little change has  been there but uh our number is right as  well like you know by education is  something that should reach each part of  this land so everybody understands and  what it is and without knowing how will  you know who is gay who is trans person  like you know till date i would say that  uh in 2022 if i go  uh to a village and someone will not be  if i tell or someone gets to know i'm a  trans woman i think there'll be  reactions still because education has  not reached in that land on that part of  india legally problem near  socially yes i think society society  wise there's a lot to do  we have not even near the ten  legally problems  because uh yeah  section 37 decriminalizes homosexuality  but it has not given us equal rights we  can't marry we can't uh have inheritance  of property uh we can't divorce we can't  do a lot of stuff inheritance is  property in returns a property from i  mean if i have a partner there is no  inheritance of property of by the  partner  how it is in the cisgender yeah partners  so there are multiple issues still there  so i mean whether i want to get married  or not that's a personal question  probably i don't option though but i  have to i should have the option of  saying yes or no  so i'm not very sure so i would not  comment about surrogacy and adoption so  i think there are problems there as well  so legally are we there we are not there  um  i want to ask you this  after you transitioned  um  it obviously changed the way you look my  life's changed your life changed right  has dating been  more difficult after uh  you know  your transition  so you know i will uh say that uh dating  live of course um  being on like of course i used to use  few of the social apps too  we're humans we want friends we look out  for new people  so then when i was like you know swiping  on you know men in the town  so there were times that um  i would get a lot of swipes because of  my pictures or maybe some guy likes me  or  but the way i look away i talk whatever  so you know someone has liked me and  then then comes the hard part  so before that hard part comes i've kept  in my mind i used to mention transgender  women  so i don't want to question that in in a  separate part does it put you in an  uncomfortable spot when the conversation  gets to there because you know what my  imagine i'm dating a sweet guy tomorrow  and  um a heterosexual guy  so  if the person doesn't know about my past  i have to say eventually right because  i've had a  incident like this back in bomby where i  was dating this guy so i just randomly  met him at a club in south bambi and  so he didn't know about me we met at a  club loud music and everything so he  didn't know about me and then eventually  i found that he was having feelings for  me i would hang out with him for coffees  and everything so eventually i had to  come out to him and tell him so then  it's like i'm liking the guy as well and  if i tell him i'm transitioning so my  what the hell is this oh [ __ ] so it's  of course it is so you know i think  dating side very few people will  understand they have this mind like  a heterosexual guy in my  historic movements and everything that i  would have understood that is the guy  would ask you  why are you operated or you have you  have you been through the process have  you not been through the process or you  look operated this is the kind of things  that i've got because okay how are you  so possible right so that's possible  like someone cannot understand that  you're a transgendered person  okay yeah i'm sorry  so i'm guessing that  the situation would be much worse for  some men it might not be possible right  and that is where my voice was for my  international pageants that i said that  you know  my voice for all those girls my heart  goes out to them  because i've seen a little bit maybe out  of hundred i've seen twenty percent of  it someone who will go through this  eighty percent of it is so hard  their life is said  to say trans women maybe or possible  aspect  what is your opinion on that because  isn't that also kind of celebrating  possible as a trans person so you know i  think beauty pageant video pageants i  would say like since i was in the  india's first transgender beauty pageant  so i think that was fine india so i  think personally that  video pageants are done to empower the  community at this point of time but at  this point at this point of time but  eventually when i go to 2040s 2050s or  beyond that i do see pageants where all  genders are  being celebrated you know so we are  going there  over time  so like if we can only if we say that  let's do miss india for everyone there  will be a problem now because right now  the education has not reached every part  so you know what is specified pronouns  when i say specified pronouns it means  letter do you see me and you will say  okay i'll address her as she her hers  that would be my first reaction reaction  because of the ideal condition condition  right when you see our number it will be  him uh his right so what happens over  here these are called pressure specified  uh pronouns apart from that there are  people who want to be dressed as they  that them right so  uh  non-binary they don't want to  necessarily be called a man or a woman  basically in the binary system  so generally the term generally is very  important a cisgendered man would say  that he has his pronouns as he him his  cisgendered woman would say my pronouns  is she her hers so basically  if you were assigned female at birth and  you identify as a woman so  generally generally she would say that  my pronoun is she her hers but there can  be conditions that she might not  right exactly gender is something which  we  identify  these are the traits of a man he looks  like a man uh the short pant penis  so  but then uh ideally i would say that in  most of the cases they are correct but  there are cases uh where you are not  correct and in no way if it's a 10  percent that doesn't mean that they are  not important of course they are equally  important so  you know we don't know enough people who  have come out as right anything so if  you're not confident what i feel  encourage even  many a times i face situations where i  was not sure that what is the correct  pronoun to use  very politely and there are ways of  asking you can ask that listen mr x or  mrs white or miss x miss by joby okay  i'm not very sure  sorry mr and mrs exactly  the first question you ask every time  you meet someone yeah  every time you're confused  i think you know i'm i have a solution  here just trying to oh  you know the best way to put it politely  is like tomorrow i see someone i would  say hi good evening what are your  pronouns or how can i address you as  yeah how politely you can ask but  natasha  so i just want to understand  how do we make this a thing that people  actually follow  okay um you know what i mean i mean see  again there's a uh i see  educated  working class  probably they are aware of  if you ask you know someone  not within the specified spectrum that  okay you ask me my pronoun before they  will say what [ __ ] is talking  right so it's easier said than done  but there should be a starting point it  has already started in uh in one  location  in one in one section of the society it  has started  uh and we should uh we should try  encouraging it more but then uh how fast  we can do it is a very difficult  question and also  you know  not practical it's not practical i mean  because every conversation doesn't start  like no and also  if  mother  intention  genuinely interested if you really want  to know ask it otherwise don't really  i have a i have a uh i would severely  mind if someone wants to behave very  inclusive in public and show that oh my  god i'm aware of it and ask what is your  preferred phone number she actually he  or she gives up you know doesn't care  and they don't use them properly don't  use them properly just to be cool  you don't have to ask it ok  so  especially someone who's not very  sensitive about these topics and hasn't  read a lot  she okay this person's pronouns are not  he him  looks like how a man dresses but  the pronoun  like do you apologize do you i do okay  of course okay in a corporate sector i  do think yeah but not all i mean i think  it should be in regular life as well so  i apologize yeah i'm so sorry to you  know but dress you as that so thank you  for making me correct i think how  beautiful you can say that also you know  in many we are trained that how gender  neutral we can be instead of saying that  hi boys and girls hi ladies and  gentlemen  just  i'm addressing you too as guys  guys so tell me so in my office if you  write an email with high guys we have  the right not to respond to you  wow yeah you always have to use gender  neutral language like hi friends and  folks which is no gender someone someone  wrote an email that to the chairman  and the email was declined because it  should be chaired person not chairman  how willing are you to learn  because  i wrote one email saying manpower  planning  my manager declined the meeting saying  make it resource planning because  manpower yeah so gender neutral terms of  the way yeah like hello people it's the  safest  yeah fair yeah and i also think that if  you know you're addressing a crowd  okay if you just say hello folks hello  people everybody feels included yeah  exactly  right  you know what i mean yeah very good  point you know i think psychologically  you feel well i'm a part of it yeah yeah  you're addressing me as well and enough  so about coming up let's talk talk about  sorry coming out let's talk about coming  up how how difficult is it has it been  for you to come out versus like in  general also how difficult i'm sure you  know a lot more stories of  you know queer people how difficult is  it really to come out  it depends on a lot of social and  economic uh you know condition because  uh most of the time financial financial  conditions because for me it was  difficult because  i was not sure uh you know how my family  would react  it wasn't i mean many people would say  that oh you are privileged and you have  a you know you have a very easy life but  then uh i wrote my own story it wasn't  very easy in the beginning because i  also had my share of you know  humiliation and cross questioning and i  was also taken to a doctor that you know  is my son you know  what what is he saying  so but then uh with education if i could  change the mind of my mother and also i  come from a huge joint family with 300  you know relatives with the same surname  i have  successfully changed all their mind  they're very very comfortable with you  know the queer community the lgbtiq  community they know a lot about it  because i have spread word about it so  uh  now it is easy but coming out was  difficult it is still difficult for most  of the people in india  i think it's also a very you know  personal decision whether you really  want to come out or not because if a  straight person is not coming out and  calling out loud in public then i don't  think uh  straight insane  i see my intention is very different  because i am very comfortable i want to  talk about it because there should be  someone who should be talking about are  you willing to make that i'm willing to  make that impact not everyone is  comfortable so  coming out not coming out is something  you know very very personal but it is  still very difficult  when you decide to come out to someone  see i generally i don't look at any  quality i come out to everyone because  i'm just being me  so as i said that in a gym i would still  say oh my god this guy is hot and  obviously my you know it's all almost  like coming out  and then the one question is  and whether you accept it or you don't  accept it it's your problem it's not my  problem  after  you transitioned  right and then they meet you again so  how has that been like because it's like  you have made the change that you wanted  to mm-hmm and you have accepted yourself  but bakilo bibi  still lagging behind  so i think um you know like a lot of  people have uh  my like out of ten friends five has been  lost  in that journey he lost friends yes  because transitioned because i  transitioned they had a problem or  they couldn't take me  whatever you've done you've done with  your body with my body but then they had  a problem i don't know why i still  figured out some time but i tell that  that i think the universe pushed them  out so you're glad  i'm glad good actually it's good  riddance yeah so probably you know  something was there in the karmic  connection so it's gone so i think it's  good because you know if they couldn't  have accepted me during that time so  there's so many other trans women they  will be coming across will do the same  thing right so what's the use  and also let's talk about they don't  want to grow let's also talk about  how unsafe life is for  trans people in general  like i mean you could still afford the  surgery you could  eventually get there but there are so  many people who struggle for like  shelter right there's so many of them  that we see on the streets mm-hmm and  they have also been kind of  demonized  and you know it's almost become  it's become an insult word  as a trans person what do you want to  say because  but people who are struggling out on the  roads also  whatever traffic signals pay red lights  life must be really hard for them right  of course life is i'm sure because you  know  i was doing this uh documentary on uh  the transgender life when i was in my  media college in uh calcutta so what  happened was uh that was my first year i  remember that was my project right so  i literally went shona garcia is one of  the most  highlighted places in the world like for  uh prostitution and for red you know  these work so he went there and i saw  this uh you literally get 15 rupees  a person and a night to millions of  money over there so you saw these trans  girls who are standing and  i on purpose went and i asked because i  wanted to know that johnny to one of  them i asked and she was like going to  get a meal for like you know for a night  by sleeping with someone it touched my  heart like why would she  do this you know why does she has to do  this and go through so much of pain  right so i personally feel that um this  is happening because insensitivity  towards the community first second would  be lack of education again comes back  third is the government how much of  extension of hand the government is  giving as well  talk about being gay and what are the  things that people don't understand  about gay people  i mean uh i'm gay but then i'm not  sexually frustrated  that's what i want to say because the  moment you come out to a straight man  i'm like i have faced this so many times  in my life that i'm getting like oh  don't touch my listeners  there are different kinds of subtle  homophobia i mean you know  you accept a  gay friend but you don't accept your gay  brother  this is  great you know i'm one of those liberal  mothers i wouldn't mind uh my son being  gay next day when the sun comes out i  have this example in my family she  howled and cried my son is gay my son is  gay and what happened to those dialogues  two years back  huh so uh those are subtle homophobia  there are there is subtle homophobia  within the community too there are many  gay people who would say  are they  typical  you are not you know this is not one of  those behaviors this is all the  homophobia what is typical  who is gay he dresses up like he doesn't  have any traits  uh which is like visibly you know just  straight passing by and then you would  say why do so typically this is also a  homophobic behavior homophobic dialogue  i mean  you're too gay for our liking huh you  know so there can be  and what about like what are the common  things that people say to transphobic  you know what i mean  there are various ways you can show it  one is uh which i have faced with silent  discrimination  when i used to work and when i started  working at a company so i would like  initial days when i transitioned i would  definitely feel that you know i was not  a part of the company when people are  having dinner you know lunches together  and everything i would not be called  because in oki or she's transitioning i  don't know what is she doing  this typical mindset of having that oh  she's transitioning means means she's  sleeping around  i'm sorry i'm not available for everyone  you know there's likings between people  right so you know that mindset i think  this these are like what transphobic  behavior end of the day because you are  not playing a part to be together when  you're having lunches to talk to your  fellow colleagues and everything and the  second is i definitely feel that  transgender means easily a lay down  that's the wrong conception i would just  not want to sleep until it's without the  consent of two person why would i get  attracted to every man i have my choices  i have my free will towards the mind so  i think that is one so and then third is  like you know i feel that um  this is changing i believe because with  my uh experience of dating then till  last few years um and i shared this with  my partner as well that earlier things  were like oh she's a trance means  let's meet her at the corner understand  her this and that and everything but  things are changing on that so that's a  transphobic behavior  you know the moment that you see someone  trans transitioning transgender like you  like oh my god i don't want to be  hanging out with the person and  everything but you want to sleep around  have a good time so that's wrong  so i was already discussing this with  natasha um  which is why i'm asking this um can you  do you mind telling us about your  surgeries and the whole process of  transitioning because  like we've already understood key  transition  for a trans person it's a very personal  choice yeah again i mean it's person to  person like whoever wants to do it can  do it whoever doesn't want to do it it's  fine like it's end of the day but for  people who may want to do it  what is  what are the things that people need to  understand about the whole process of  transitioning and the surgeries and  right so i think um i will place it like  this that first of all surgeries are  hard you know when you undergo surgery  it's not easy because i have with my  experience of surgeries i would say that  my pain began from the time my  anesthesia was over that is where the  pain begins because you know  yes the pain and everything comes right  because once you're in the ot table you  don't get to know you just like they put  sedation and you're gone right you're  just um senseless so i think you know  over here i would say that um  the surgeries i've gone through a  series of surgeries so first one being  just one month late first they do some  um hormonal hrt it's hormonal therapy  for rigorous three years  yes that is the first one because uh  during operations  of course that's before the surgery so  what is the first step the first step is  you go to the psychologist and the  psychiatrist  you start having a friend to start  ,M,328081,259,20,"Jun 24, 2022"

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses.

You wander floor by floor,

cleaning the world,

As if hanging from the sky.

But when you see a mirror, and take a pause,

Man, you slay!

You, who don't let fights get ugly,

when you steal a glance to look at your clothes,

you really look cute.

In the traffic's rage

you sound like an Indian classical flute

And when you bring flowers for yourself too,

Man, you slay!

You take time out of ledgers

and make time to read a book.

Those years of struggle we spent together,

I never remember that as a bad phase

You share everything except your recipe

You dare so much, and so casually

When you almost get smitten by yourself and smile,

Man, you slay!

But when you keep your negative vibes in trash.

And instead of taking care of your ego, you take care of yourself.

You look mind-blowing.

Yet. no one has ever written poetry on your eyes,

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses

I feel I can cross any river when I am with you,

The one who is called a Gentleman in English,

My friend, that someone is you.

Gillette,Getting Ready for College: Complete Style Guide by Gillette India,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvpk_yZBHU4,"(gentle upbeat music)

- [Narrator] College is a
wonderful place to be at.

You make new friends, have fun,

and unlike school finally get
to dress up the way you want.

But since college life is eventful,

we want you to stand out
and make an impression.

So here are some quick tips
on getting ready for college.

First and foremost,
let's talk about grooming

your haircut and beard.

When it comes to your
hair, keep it simple.

An undercut is the current hair trend,

which is shorter on the
sides and longer on the top,

and is set with wax.

(air whooshing)

Tip two, a lot of you might be
getting the peach fuzz beard,

patchy in places, and not fully grown.

So it is important you shave.

Use the Gillette SkinGuard Razor.

It gives you a smooth shave,

and in case you have any
acne or skin irritation,

the unique skin guard
position between the blades

gives you a comfortable
shave without any irritation.

Now the third tip is clothes.

You don't need to spend
a lot to look good.

Simple, solid colored T-shirts with little

or no print does the trick.

They make you look cool and classy.

You can also add casual checkered shirts

or polo neck T-shirts to your wardrobe.

Fourth tip, avoid wearing
shorts to college.

Instead, wear good fitting jeans

or chinos for your everyday look.

Fifth tip, let's talk about shoes.

For college you need a pair
of sneakers or boat shoes.

They are stylish, trendy,
and look really good

with almost everything you wear.

Invest in a pair of good sneakers.

Sixth tip is accessories.

A wristwatch can never go out of fashion,

so you can always go for a metal strap

or a sporty digital watch.

You can also wear bands or
other fashion accessories

on your hand to add to your look.

The final and the most
important tip is body language.

It helps to break the
barrier of unfamiliarity

and helps to form a better
connect with everyone.

So these were some useful tips to consider

while you get ready for college.

Gillette,"How to Look Professional at Work | Essential Grooming Tips for Men | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cQ7YV0nJRY,"- [Narrator] Most of us work

in the nine to five
corporate culture today

and how you dress up
plays an important role.

Your work wear, or business
look is a reflection

of yourself and helps form an impression.

In this video, we'll give you tips

on how you can look professional

at work and make an impression.

The first and the most
important tip is grooming.

When it comes to work,

you have to ensure your hair

and beard are perfect
and not unkempt or shabby

as that can be a deal breaker.

In most corporates,
beard is not appreciated.

It looks a little unprofessional.

Having a clean shaven look

is always a safer option and goes well

with your professional look.

Avoid sporting long hair.

Instead go for short and styled hair.

The side locks should be well shaped

and close to the skin for
a neat corporate look.

Moving on to tip number two, shirts.

If you see, most corporate professionals

wear light colored solid
shirts in pastel shades.

Wear a well fitted shirt.

Loose shirts get messy and wrinkled

when you try to tuck in.

When it comes to formal trousers,

you should prefer wearing
dark colored pants.

A black gray, or a navy blue is perfect

for office wear.

Avoid wearing ankle length trousers

as it is usually looked down upon

in the corporate culture.

One wardrobe essential
for every man is a pair

of formal shoes.

And that's tip number four, shoes.

For everyday office or work wear,

you should wear black
or brown formal shoes.

Tip number five, wristwatches.

Choose a wristwatch that
goes with your outfit.

You can even experiment
wearing a smartwatch

since it's in the trend now.

Now these were some quick
tips to look your best

and make an impression.

through a lot in summer.

Sweating, tanning, oily skin
are some of the problems

we face in the summer season.

Here is a step-by-step
guide for skincare routine.

Step one, using a face wash.

Stepping out in the summer,

your skin is exposed
to pollution and heat,

which makes your skin
oily, causing breakouts,

so it is essential that
you use a face wash

at least twice a day.

Step two, scrubbing or exfoliating.

In the summers, it is
important to cleanse your pores

and remove the dead skin
cells and blackheads,

which are on the skin,

so using a scrub or an
exfoliator is important.

(upbeat music)

Step three, shaving and
trimming your beard.

In summer, it is advisable
to shave off your beard

and sport the clean look,

it helps your face stay cooler and softer.

(upbeat music)

Step four, sunscreen.

A lot of men seem to ignore this,

but sunscreen is one of the
most essentials during summers.

Tanning and skin burns

are the most common problems
faced during summer,

so it is important that
you apply sunscreen

on the parts that will
be exposed to the sun

before stepping out.

The higher the SPF, the
better protection it offers.

Step five, drink water.

In summer, it is important
to keep your skin hydrated,

and drinking water constantly
will help cleanse your skin

and face off all the toxins,
leaving it healthy and glowing.

So go ahead and enjoy your summers

with these simple hacks for your skin

and tell us what you think of

trying to prepare for a date,

especially if it's your first one.

You want everything to
be perfect and special.

However, a lot of guys are still not sure

about how to get ready for
a date, but don't worry,

we're here to show you

how to get that perfect look on your date.

First things first, you
should look presentable,

for that, you need to
pay attention to grooming

and that's step number one, grooming.

Your face says a lot about you

so pay attention to your
hairstyles and facial hair.

Facial hair is very important,

a patchy beard can be
a deal-breaker for you.

With a properly groomed look,
you can make an impression.

You can use the Gillette SkinGuard Razor,

specifically designed to protect you

from sensitive skin and razor bumps.

Wash your face with lukewarm water.

Apply the shaving gel
and shave your beard.

The Gillette SkinGuard Razor

shaves your hair without
touching your skin,

giving you a comfortable shave.

If you want to sport a beard,

make sure you trim it
and shape it properly.

An unkempt beard gives you a shabby look.

Make sure you wash your hair and style it

using a gel or wax.

Ensure your hair isn't out of place

or overgrown from one side

as it could look very messy.

Visit the salon for a
trendy haircut if required.

The next step is clothes.

Typically, a fitted silhouette
where your clothes hug,

but not constrict your
body is the way to go.

Look for items like a
tailored dinner jacket,

a straight-leg jeans, or
a slim button-down shirt.

It's all about wearing the clothes

versus letting the clothes wear you.

It also depends if you're going
on a lunch date or a dinner.

For a lunch date, choose
light-colored shirts,

whereas you could go for
brighter colors on a dinner date.

When it comes to trousers, you
can go for chinos or denims,

but avoid ripped or torn jeans

as they could be deal-breakers.

Do consider wearing something comfortable

because you don't want
to end up looking clumsy.

Tip number three, shoes.

Pick a pair of good-looking shoes.

Loafers are ideal for a date,

but you could experiment
with a pair of sneakers too.

And there you go.

Now you have all the tips and tricks

to look good on your date.

Gillette,"Must Have Shaving Products for the Perfect Shave | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4A0uFEL_Bg,"(lively music)

- [Narrator] Shaving is a part

of the everyday routine for many men.

However, in order to
get the perfect shave,

you need to choose the
right shaving essentials.

Here is a list of shaving
products you should buy

so that you do can get the perfect shave.

Before getting into the list,

let's break down the shaving
routine into three parts.

Pre-shave, shave, and post shave.

Beginning with pre-shave, the
first product is face wash.

It is essential that you wash your face

with a face wash before getting
into the shaving process.

This helps cleanse your pores and get rid

of dead skin cells and dirt on your skin.

The second product is
a shaving gel or cream.

It helps to keep the
moisture in the beard hair

during the shave, making it
softer and easier to cut.

It also acts as a layer of protection

between the razor and the
skin, ensuring less friction.

Moving on to shaving, the
most important product

in your shaving routine: the razor.

I would strongly recommend
the Gillette MACH 3.

Its strong and sharp blades
cut hair effectively.

The comfort strip on the razor indicates

when the blades are dull
and need to be changed.

The adjustable head adjusts
to the contour of your face,

making your shaving experience easier

and protects you from nicks and cuts.

(lively music)

After getting a smooth and clean shave,

you need to take care of your skin

and that's where the
post-shave products come in.

And lastly, we have an aftershave.

What an aftershave does is
prevent any skin irritation

you might get post shaving.

And also close your
pores to prevent bacteria

and other germs from settling.

And these are the products
you need for a perfect shave.

Gillette,"Best Razor for Sensitive Skin | Gillette SkinGuard | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upIZpSqcPEA,"- [Narrator] Stepping out
of your home means battling

with dust, pollution, and heat,

which affects our skin,
causing pimples or acne

and this makes shaving
difficult for most men.

However, we have a solution,

Gillette SkinGuard, a
razor which shaves hair

while barely touching the skin.

(bright music)

The first step to start shaving

is hydrating your face with warm water,

which helps soften the hair,

giving you a more comfortable shave.

Using a shaving gel.

This helps provide better lubrication

so that the razor can glide smoothly,

giving you a closer shave.

Gillette SkinGuard is designed

for anyone who loves their
skin and fears shaving

because of acne or sensitive skin.

The razor shaves hair and guards skin

due to its unique skin guard
position between the blades.

It works to minimize tug and pull

and cut hair at skin level,

helping to prevent irritation.

The Gillette SkinGuard
Razor is also equipped

with a precision trimmer at the back

to help you reach the hard places,

and style facial hair

which is difficult using the normal razor.

After the shave, rinse
you face with cold water

and dry it off.

Use an aftershave to soothe your skin.

And that's why Gillette
SkinGuard gives you

the most comfortable shave.

Gillette,"This Is How You Look Amazing in the Gym | Style Tips for Men | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV94Xqt3rr4,"- [Narrator] Going to the gym

is a daily ritual for many of us.

However, while in the gym,

we have to make a good
impression on others too,

and that's why in today's video

we're going to talk about
how to look good in the gym.

First and foremost is body grooming.

It is natural that you're going
to sweat while working out,

so it is important that
you keep your body clean.

Also, ensure that you
have a deodorant handy

to keep body odor away.

Another important thing to keep in mind

is shaving your beard,

you are ought to sweat in the gym,

and sporting your beard clogs pores,

which traps dirt and germs in your face.

That's why it is advisable to shave.

With the Gillette SkinGuard,

you can shave your beard,

protect yourself against
skin damage and irritation.

The next thing you have to keep in mind

is the right clothes in the gym.

Gym clothes have to make you comfortable

and at the same time, be flexible,

so you can work out in them easily.

The best option is to wear T-shirts

made of polyester or Lycra

as they are breathable fabrics

and you don't perspire much wearing them.

Depending on what you're comfortable with,

choose lightweight shorts or joggers,

which are made with quick-dry mesh.

The next aspect we'll talk about is shoes.

It is very important

that you have a comfortable
pair of workout shoes.

Your shoe impacts your
posture when you work out

and can cause knee injuries,

so make sure you go for a
good pair of running shoes

for your cardio sessions.

And if you're a heavyweight lifter,

get yourself a pair of lifting shoes,

which give your legs and ankle

a good support while lifting weights.

Now, let's talk about post-workout care.

After a workout, it is ideal
that you take a quick shower

to get your body clean of
all the sweat and dirt.

Sweating opens up your pores

so taking a quick shower helps get rid of

all the dirt and dead skin.

After a shower, make sure you
wear a fresh pair of clothes

before heading out.

You should consider wearing
a sports jacket or sweatshirt

to keep your body slightly
warmed up after the workout.

And that's about it.

Follow these steps to look
good and cool in the gym.

Gillette,"5 Reasons to Choose MACH3 over Disposable Razors | Gillette MACH3 Overview | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwfSgL5sBw,"(upbeat music)

- [Narrator] As men, we've
all used disposable razors

once in our lifetime,

or probably still using it,

however, it's time to upgrade.

(upbeat music continues)

Here are a few reasons

why Gillette Mach3 razors are superior

compared to your three
blade disposable razors.

First reason is sharper blades,

which are engineered to
give you a close shave.

The Gillette Mach3 is equipped
with thinner, sharper blades

with better coating which
gives a smoother glide,

resulting in less force
being used while shaving.

Long-lasting blades,

the Gillette Mach3
blades are built stronger

and durable as compared
to disposable blades,

so they hold up better to wear and tear

and last as long as 60 days.

Comfort strip,

the Gillette Mach3 comes

with a blue-green comfort strip,

which is an indicator for dull blades.

If the strip is faded or white,

it's a sign that the blades have worn out

and need to be changed.

Another reason is adjustable head.

The Gillette Mach3 comes
with an adjustable head,

which adjusts to the
contours of your face,

which an ordinary razor cannot,

so you get a smoother precision shape.

The open architecture of
the blades make it easier

to clean out the excessive
hair that gets stuck.

Just rinsing it with water is enough

to get rid of the hair

instead of wiping it
with a cloth or towel.

And these are the reasons

for you to dump the disposable razor

and upgrade to a Gillette
Mach3 razor today.

Gillette,"How to Shave for the First Time | Shaving Tips for Men | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nYGwpofDVo,"- [Announcer] Want to
start shaving your beard

but not sure on how to start?

Here are a few tips for all you guys

shaving for the first time.

The most important thing is identifying

when to start shaving.

Ideally, you should only start shaving

when you start getting a peach fuzz.

A peach fuzz is that slight patchy beard

and mustache grown as a teenager.

Before we get into the shaving process,

here are the products that are essential

in the shaving routine.

Face wash, Gillette foam
or gel, Gillette razor,

after shave lotion.

First hydrate your skin with warm water,

this will help open up your pores

and soften your facial hair
preventing nicks and burns.

Use a face wash to get rid of
the oil, dirt, and dead skin

preparing your skin for
a comfortable shave.

Then take a small amount
of shaving gel on your hand

and apply it on the beard.

Make sure you apply a
thin even layer of it.

A thick layer will prevent the razor

from reaching the hair
making your shave difficult.

Before you start shaving
check the compass strip

on the razor, if it is white
it means your razor blades

are worn out and have to be changed.

If it is blue or green, it
means your razor is okay to use.

Gillette Mach3 has sharper blades

and a pivot head that takes the pressure

of your hand away from the blades

for better skin comfort
and a cleaner shave,

use light gentle strokes
letting the razor do the work.

You are more prone to nicks and cuts

if you apply too much force

or try to move the razor too swiftly.

The Gillette SkinGuard has a flexible head

which adjusts according to your face,

so it is easy to shape even
the trickiest of places.

(upbeat music)

Rinse your razor frequently to
get rid of the excessive hair

that might be stuck to the blades.

So now the question arises
with or against the grain,

the answer is both, facial
hair grows in any direction,

so shave in the direction
you are comfortable with.

Ideally, shaving both
with and against the grain

should be good to get
rid of the facial hair.

Post-shave, wash your
face with cold water,

this will help close all
the pores on your face

keeping your skin fresh.

(upbeat music)

The last step in the shaving process

is applying an aftershave lotion,

an aftershave acts as a disinfectant

and helps keep skin moisturized,
making you smell good.

And this is how you go about
your first shaving experience.

experience in the comments below.

- Grooming is an essential part of style.

If you want to look good,
you have to be well-groomed.

Here are some quick tips to
maintain a well-groomed look.

Tip one, pay attention to your hair.

A lot of men don't pay
attention to their hair.

Overgrown, unkempt hair
can give you a very messy,

shabby appearance.

So get a haircut, often.

Wash, manage and style your
hair so it looks perfect

but don't overload it
with styling products.

Tip two, use a face wash.

The skin on your face is more
sensitive than your body.

That's why soap is not the solution.

A good face wash helps you
cleanse your pores, get rid

of oils and dead skin cells
and exfoliates your skin.

(cool music)

Tip three, shave that beard.

A clean shaving look makes
you look fresher and younger

so make sure you shave regularly.

Invest in a good razor.

The Gillette MACH3, but
stronger than steel blades

and an adjustable head
gives you a smooth shave

and leaves you looking
well-groomed in minutes.

Tip four, smell good always.

Body odor can be a deal breaker.

Make sure you use a good
deodorant or perfume

which lasts long, leaving
your smelling good

even after a long day.

Before stepping out, apply
sunscreen on your face and hands.

It'll protect your skin against UV days

and prevent skin tanning.

Gillette,"How to Transform into a Stylish Good-Looking Man | Men’s Style Makeover | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VaWMVb-SqY,"- [Narrator] Being stylish is
a skill that not all men have.

Some men are blessed with
it, while some are not.

However, being stylish is not hard,

but you can always learn and improve.

In this video,

we'll take you through
men's style transformation.

Starting from the top,

first, let's talk about hair.

Invest in good hair products
like shampoo, conditioner,

which help your hair look good

and style them to create
a rocking impression.

A shabby and unkempt beard

will give you a messy appearance,

even if you wear the best of clothes,

so it is important you shave your beard,

Having a clean-shaven look

makes you look younger and fresher.

The Gillette MACH3 with stronger blades,

glides on your skin,

giving you a smooth, comfortable shape.

Now let's talk about clothes.

Baggy and loose is out of fashion.

Make sure your clothes fit you well,

not too tight, or too loose.

Denims are a must have,

but play around with your look

by trying out some cool chinos.

Chinos are stylish casuals

that give you a smarter look than denims.

Moving on to your shoes.

Invest in a pair of loafers or sneakers,

they match with every outfit you wear,

and make you look cool and stylish.

And this is how you can transform

into a stylish, good looking man.

Gillette,"How to Get Ready for Indian Wedding | Outfits For Men | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSpjBIQ6D3A,"- [Narrator] Indian
weddings are nothing short

of a giant celebration,

But the problem a lot of
men face when it comes

to weddings is how to get
ready for different functions.

First and most important
is grooming yourself well.

If we have to break it down further

it's about your hairstyle and facial hair.

The latest hairstyle
trend is the undercut,

built on short sites and a long top

which creates a cool and
classy look for all hair types.

When it comes to facial
hair for a wedding look,

a clean shaven look is a
classic for any occasion.

If you want to keep a beard,

make sure it's a light stubble
just holding your face.

You can use Gillette skinguard
to get a comfortable shave.

It works to minimize tug and pull

and cuts hair while
barely touching the skin.

Traditionally, Indian weddings
have four to five functions

and here we take you
through what you can wear

for each function to stand
out and make an impression.

Starting out with the Mehendi ceremony.

For men, Mehendi ceremony
is a fairly simple function

which doesn't require too much effort

when it comes to an outfit.

A smart and well-fitted
Kurta pajama does the trick.

When it comes to Kurta
remember, simple is elegant.

The next function which
is usually followed

by the Mehendi, is the Haldi.

Usually this function happens in the day,

so you can wear light
color Churidar and Kurta's.

Shades of yellows, oranges,
off whites are apt.

You can add a Nehru jacket to your look

and make it a little more
elegant and different,

but go easy on the embroidery and prints.

One of the most fun-filled

and most loved functions of any

Indian wedding is the Sangeet.

Here you can experiment
with different outfits.

You can try a waist coat with formal pants

for a sharp Dapper
look, or a casual blazer

with jeans and a t-shirt
for a chilled out look.

If you want to stick to their
traditional Indian attire

and Indo western outfit or a Pathani

does go well to suit the occasion.

The main wedding ceremony
is an auspicious affair,

so it is important you dress well for it.

Ideally, a Sherwani is
apt for the occasion,

but you can also opt for a
Nehru jacket or a Bandhgala.

Preferably choose pastel
shades that look elegant.

The last function is a reception.

For men, a reception outfit
usually comprises of a suit.

Every man should ideally own

a well-made suit in his wardrobe

for occasions like these.

You can even experiment
by wearing a good blazer

or a waist coat that make you look classy,

yet not too formal.

So this was our idea of
dressing perfect for a wedding.

Gillette,"Save Money With These Grooming Hacks for Men | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3efUDsCC6Q,"(tranquil music)

- [Narrator] Looking
good does not come cheap.

Grooming is an expensive affair,

investing money in products
for your skin and hair.

Actually not.

In today's video,

let us show you quick grooming hacks,

which don't burn a hole in your pocket.

The first hack is,

always use a serum or
conditioner regularly

if your hair gets frizzy.

Take a small amount of serum on your palm,

rub it on your hands,

and then just glide your
hands through your hair

and your set.

The frizziness almost disappears.

You could also choose olive
oil to get rid of dry scalp.

Hack two is, invest in
a good durable razor

instead of disposable blades.

Shaving is an essential part

of every man's grooming routine.

The Gillette Mach 3 Razor

comes with stronger than steel blades,

which last up to 60 days

and give a comfortable clean shave.

Hack three is, instead of spending money

on expensive products

find alternative products in your kitchen.

For example, tea bags to
get rid of dark circles

instead of spending money on
dark circle-removing cream.

Or baking soda for sparkling white teeth.

And these were quick money-saving
grooming hacks for men.

First, let me trim to get an even length of

For any style of beard to look good you need to clean up your neck and upper cheek

 even for the thickest and longest beards.

If you follow me or Ocean, you must be assuming we usually get ourselves styled by good stylists

Before every game we groom ourselves nicely

But really this is my pro stylist to get clear 
sharp beard lines you need a safe single blade  

A barber's Ustra or even a safety razor in which 
you screw in a blade needs a lot of practice but  

this back blade is perfectly safe while giving 
you well defined beard edges.

Gillette,Grooming Kit for Men | Essential Products to Look Your Best | Gillette India,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DThdOEVETXk,"(gentle music)

- [Narrator] For a modern, stylish man,

grooming is a crucial aspect of his life

and that is why a lot
depends on his grooming kit.

A lot of you may be wondering

what goes into a man's grooming kit.

Today we'll take you through
the essentials you should have

in your grooming kit.

First is hair styling products.

Everyone loves styling their hair,

and for that it is important
you have the right help,

so hair styling products

like good shampoo, hair gel, or wax

should be a part of your grooming kit.

Second is a shower gel.

A shower gel helps clean
your skin, fight odor,

and keeps you fresh.

Third is a shaving kit.

This needs no explanation.

A shaving kit, comprising
of a razor, shaving cream,

shaving brush, trimmer, and
extra blades, is essential.

The Gillette Mach3 razor
with stronger blades

and adjustable head helps
not only shave your beard

but your body too.

Next is a face wash.

Soap is too harsh for your face.

It needs something more sensitive

and that's where a face wash comes in.

It eliminates dirt, impurities,

and removes dead skin from the face.

Fifth is deodorant.

Everyone perspires.

It's natural, but you have to make sure

it doesn't overpower your
scent and leave odor.

It is important to keep a deodorant handy

so you can smell good always.

Last is sunscreen.

You are out most of the time,

traveling for work or enjoying a sport.

You're always exposed to the sun

so it is important to keep a sunscreen.

The SPF blocks the sun

and prevents your skin from getting tan.

These were your grooming kit essentials.

Gillette,The Best Facial Hairstyles for Men | Beard & Moustache Styles | Gillette India,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Why7Hspmk3U,"(upbeat music)

- [Narrator] In the past few years,

facial hair has become
one of the biggest trends

when it comes to men's fashion,

and styling it has
become an essential part

of men's grooming or shaving routine.

In today's video, we will show you

the best facial hair trends for men

and how to get them right.

First, we have a classic
French beard, a circular beard

connecting your chin
patch to your mustache.

For this look, apply shaving
gel to the sides of your beard

and shave it completely
without touching the chin,

mustache, and the part connecting it.

The five blade technology
of Gillette Fusion

gives you a clean, smooth,
and comfortable shave.

The next look is Anchor or Van Dyke beard,

a beard which traces the
chin with the mustache.

For this look, apply shaving
gel on your upper chin,

the connecting part between
the beard and the mustache,

and shave it off.

Shape the edges of your
mustache and lower chin

using the precision trimmer

present in the back of
the Gillette Fusion razor.

The Gillette Fusion razors
have a precision trimmer blade

on the back of the cartridge
for accurate edging.

Now talking about the mustache look,

first, we have the chevron
or the thick mustache,

a mustache which covers your top lip.

For this look, shave of the
remaining beard from your chin

and sport only the mustache.

The next mustache look is the
original or pencil mustache,

a thin mustache that just
sits above your upper lip.

For this, trim the excessive
hair on your mustache

using a trimmer or scissors,

then shape the edges using
the precision trimmer

at the back of the Gillette Fusion razor

to shape and style your mustache.

So these were some quick
and trendy facial hairstyles

for you to try at home.

Gillette,"Shaving Myths: All You Need To Know | Gillette India",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeqfFgtC2k,"(laid back music)

- [Narrator] Shaving has been
synonymous to men's grooming

from time immemorial.

However, over the years, a lot of myths

have also built up because of this.

Today, we're going to talk to you

about the various shaving
myths that are out there.

Myth one, shaving every day
makes your beard grow faster.

How thick your beard is
and how fast it grows

totally depends on your
hereditary factors.

Your genes and hormones

determine how quick or
thick your hair grows.

Myth two, pressing harder
gives you a close shave.

If you press too hard on your
razor, you might cut yourself.

Keep the razor flat on your
skin and gently glide it,

letting your razor do all the work.

Also, avoid stroking the
same area again and again.

Myth three, water alone is
enough for a good shave.

Water is not a lubricant.

To help your razor smoothly
glide over your skin,

you need to use a shaving cream or gel

that straightens the hair,
making it easier to shave.

Myth four, a new blade
increases the risk of cuts.

In fact, an older razor is
more likely to cause nicks

and cut your skin because you
have to shave the same area

over and over again to
get rid of your hair.

A new blade makes your
shaving smooth and easy,

getting rid of hair with a gentle glide.

Now that we have busted
some shaving myths for men,

tell us if you have come
across any such myths

backgrounds whether that is with your

design career or expertise so first and

foremost I want to hear a little bit

about your Journeys as

a designer in this creative field tell

us a little bit about how everything got

started for you I'll start with you

Kenya

we don't have enough time

um well I am formally trained I went to

college to be a designer

um which I still owe a lot of money in

student loans

um

I am from Norfolk Virginia I went to

college

really

hey girl

that's weird

oh so I went to okay so real let me make

this real fast I was a crazy Rebel kid

in high school I wanted to be pretty I

almost didn't graduate high school I had

to go to a um I had to take either

woodwork or fashion merchandising to

graduate high school of course I took

fashion merchandising

um it was an eye-opener for me my GPA

sucked I barely got into college got

into college had too much fun in college

my mom sent me to Atlanta to go to a

technical school which was no band no

parties or nothing but I still found a

party then I got I learned how to sew

and make patterns and then after that I

thought that I was going to go to New

York and work for Donna Karen and then

the world said no I ended up being a

bartender and then I was bartending and

waiting tables and then I was making

clothes at night and then I was poor and

then my lights will go out and then I

would take the extension cord and when

everyone else asleep and I would plug it

outside of my building because they had

power and I would make clothes because

I'm like I got 800 I'm getting the gun

to buy fabric I'm gonna pay rent and

then I will still pour

and man one it was like and then I had

like this very crazy moment as an adult

when you have to move back home with Mom

and then I had to go to back to Virginia

and then they made me very sad and then

like three months into being in Virginia

um something just said apply for a

Project Runway and I'm like that's

bananas because that show that make no

sense you can't make clothes that

quickly and then I did

and then I messed up the application I

put like monkey pictures and like Mickey

Mouse and then the very next day they

called and they said we want you on the

show and I said why and then

and then they said we think you're great

but please send us some good pictures

and then I made it on the show and I

made it to the top five and then I came

home and then I was poor again and then

I was sleeping on sofas I was literally

sleeping on the floor in my studio and I

was taking showers I mean well bird

baths or whole baths whatever they call

them at the at the local grocery store

at 7 A.M and then I would come back to

my studio like I was never there because

I would sleep on the floor and then life

just kept turning but I never stopped

and I think because I didn't stop and I

kept going uh life keeps showing me all

the great things that it has to offer

okay

foreign

oh my gosh

what is story and Kenya all of that led

you here today yeah amazing thank you so

much for sharing I was here for the ride

I loved it so much and I didn't cry oh

uh of course

we gotta hear Armand tell us about your

career your journey how did you get here

today well my story is way shorter

I have to make it short so I was born

and raised in Albania and I was drawing

and sketching ever since I was five I

went to art school over there and then

my phone I found my way to Dubai I

started working in the fashion industry

as a creative director for different

brands and just because I was doing

fashion illustration on Instagram that's

where she informed me so basically I

don't have a fashion design background

but that's always been something that I

wanted to do so uh yeah I was so so

happy when she when she reached out

because I was always lacking confidence

on not being able to construct my own

designs I was like maybe I'm I cannot be

a designer

but yeah it worked out and you know here

I am so here you are today I love that

story because I feel like a lot of us

can get in our own ways sometimes or if

we absolutely absolutely don't be the

one to tell yourself no ever exactly uh

and of course Valerie we're so happy to

have you here today how did everything

come to be with your career well

um I was actually designing jewelry when

I was in first grade I got in trouble

um I got sent home because the teacher

caught me selling at recess and they're

like you can't sell at school

um so I got sent home and they told my

mom and it was a big deal and so I

couldn't sell my jewelry which I was

really sad

um when I was in third grade I kept

doing it anyways I was like I'm making

money so I am going to keep doing this I

actually bought tickets to Disneyland

when I was in third grade very proud of

myself

um

and yeah similar story to Kenya the

struggle with being a designer

um not having a traditional education

you know being self-taught you know I

took the more punk rock route where I

taught myself everything I took clothes

apart I figured it out on my own I

didn't have guidance I didn't have I

didn't really have like a support

network so in a way you know I had to

carve my own path

um and yeah here I am today you know

just keep writing and the same with you

Kenya you know don't give up you know

the the odds will be against you but you

know just keep pushing through and and

you'll shine

yes absolutely

I love that you were selling jewelry in

first grade that's an iconic story I'm

sorry for that yeah boring a young

business woman

I know you all have participated in

various activities within the she and X

program including our very first 100K

challenge which I don't know if you guys

know we get a super cool design

competition Series where we had uh

different designers mentored by some of

the biggest names in fashion including

Christian siriano uh Jenna lions and

Khloe Kardashian

it was nuts uh what I'd love to hear

from each of you is what would you say

has been the most memorable moment in

your career in the she and X Program so

far or maybe a the most memorable

campaign you've been a part of and I'll

start with you Armand

okay so she next 100K was definitely the

most memorable one because we had like a

month to create the design bring them to

life shoot them and then promote them

and do everything and I enjoyed the

process so much so that was the real

campaign that I was like okay I can I

can do this full time you know I can see

myself doing this and I was super happy

with the results I I was playing with

Prince that's where I started playing

around with Prince and I was like I was

finding my identity as a designer and I

also I was voted I got most votes from

the audience which was amazing

so seeing everybody's feedback and how

people I would see people's feedback

wearing my clothes and they would

comment on the size on the on the

material and how comfortable they are

and yeah that's that's what I wanted

actually so I was I was super happy

amazing amazing and how about you

Valerie okay so it was it was a

challenge like when they said the 100K

challenge challenge yes it was a major

challenge

um one of the most memorable events that

happened actually was

staying up till 4am with Kenya

um something had happened where one of

her pieces from the runway went missing

and she needed to sew another one the

next day and our call time was like at 8

A.M I think so I invited her to sew at

my studio and we stayed up till I would

say like 4 30 and made it happen and she

constructed the jacket we had some help

and showed up 8 A.M the next day half

asleep and yeah pushed through so that

was one of the most memorable moments

actually

was like the bonding and like all of the

contestants were helping each other so

like the comradeship you know was cool

yeah that sounds awesome I love when

like when it comes to it and you got to

work together and you got to make

something happen you you surprise

yourself sometimes with what you can

accomplish yeah absolutely and Kenya

tell us memorable moment campaign

well first of all thank you girl yes of

course

um if any of you have ever had a moment

where you had to create on a dime

and in a moment I'd be so surprised at

what I can do or where my adrenaline

level will take me but I think for me

um

they definitely robbed me of my 100K

um she and y'all owe me some money

it was it was pretty dope and uh she and

please bring it back

um it is so needed

um it will really help take Brands to

the next level please please please

bring it back

[Laughter]

um

it was adrenaline rushing to his point I

mean we had a month we had to make a

collection do a shoot for the collection

like presented again I mean come to La

um I was super psyched because Chris and

siriano was my mentor

and I got to fly to New York and meet

him and hang out with him and it was

pretty dope I'm not gonna lie the 100K

contest is intense is a hundred thousand

headaches but it was intense it was

needed it was it was everything

um it was I think we all agree it was

has to be the most

um the most memorable

um yeah

she in as his dog

I love it I think that's so great that

this was such a special moment for all

of you she stayed up to four o'clock in

the morning to help me make a jacket oh

my gosh yes Round of Applause for that

please

oh my gosh here for that listen we love

the support we love the support uh

speaking of design challenges I mean it

must be tricky coming up with ideas and

getting inspiration for pieces that

you're creating and you're all she Next

Top performers so what I would love to

hear oh yeah take the moment what I

would love to hear is what how do you

get that inspiration to keep your

collections top of mind for seeing

consumers how do you keep things fresh

I'm going to start with you Valerie

well

um I mean we've been Trend setting for a

long time we've been doing this for a

really long time

um and actually we're pretty responsible

for a lot of the trends you see in like

the mainstream Marketplace

um like the baggy style for instance

that blew up

um with Billy that was us we did like

the gender fluid oversized garments and

then that became you know a trend and

then everyone started wearing you know

like the oversized like

pieces so yeah I mean I just think that

we have a natural attack for just

knowing like what's on the Forefront

like what's going to be next so it's

usually off

off the beaten path you know it's

yeah

I know you obviously started being

creative in such a businesswoman at a

very very young age would you say this

is something that that's always come

natural for you yeah actually I mean I

was actually going to school to be a

teacher I was going to be an educator

and so I was just using fashion as like

a side hustle I was like oh it makes me

money like cool people like what I'm

wearing or oh I can make this shirt or

this necklace and I would sell it and

then you know just kept throughout my

whole life through school everywhere I

was just like oh okay I could sell these

shirts I'm making I could sell this

jewelry and so yeah it was just a part

of my journey just growing up

absolutely and Kenya how about you how

do you feel you keep the collections

fresh come up with all of these ideas

each time

I fly to L.A and buy edibles

[Laughter]

um I think I'll pay attention to well

one I pay attention to my audience and I

I'm always asking my audience what do

you like

um if I make this dress will you buy it

do you like this color and that's

important because they are the ones who

are going to buy it and so when working

with qian I'm paying attention to like

who their customer is what she like

what's trending and trying to make like

what I consider to be my classic pieces

without being super trendy because I

don't like things that like go away I

want you to buy something and be able to

wear it all the time in any season and

with your sneakers and your heels and

whatever you want

um so it just really just paying

attention and a lot of it is just

kind of a shot in the dark and you'd be

like oh they like that like okay

he's saying I love the honesty as well

because I know a lot of us were so

curious about this you know we I'm gonna

tell you I don't know how you all do it

I'm so impressed by each one of you and

so I love hearing that process and and

how you come up with these amazing

pieces

um Armand how about you so for me the

strategy I was following when it comes

to designing I never want to be limited

to only one type of woman and one type

of body type

so every time we had one of these

challenges where they designed a

three-piece collection and I want every

type of woman who goes in my site and

sees the collection to find themselves

at least in one of the pieces and I want

to design for different age groups

different bodies different skin tones

of course I follow the trends you know I

keep up with the trends and I try to

like embrace them and put them in my

designs so I guess yeah that's why it's

been working I guess yeah 100

do you feel like you've had to Pivot the

way you designed to cater she in

consumers at all and if so how do you

keep your brand identity throughout

in a way yes because I do love to

interact with people I love to hear the

feedback I love to see what's selling

more what do people like so yeah it's

it's important I mean it's important to

create and come up with amazing pieces

but in the end of the day you have to

think as a businessman as well you know

you you want your pieces to sell so you

want to give the customers what they're

asking for

absolutely Kenya how about you

do you feel like you've had to Pivot uh

your designs at all to cater to she and

customers

um

not really I think I've been able to

stay true to who I am as a brand I think

the most important part of being a

designer is staying true to who I am

it's like that fine line of staying true

to who you are but you're also working

with another brand so trying to also

stay relevant and identify what who

their customer is too but without losing

yourself it can be it can be it can be a

little weird but all I'm gonna do me I'm

gonna do me and hopefully that me doing

me is going to make sense to anybody

who's going to buy it um I am five feet

I am 242 pounds yes that's what I said

um and so it matters to me when I look

at like how to dress like a curvy body

even from desires size 0 to the 20 we

all have like that curve and I want to

make sure that I am making that curve

look as fabulous as possible

yes 100 you got to be cute girl

absolutely I love it I love it and

Valerie how about you do you feel like

you've had to Pivot at all no not at all

actually if anything I feel like it's

been really

um helpful

um because it's offering freak City LA

to a customer base at like a super

affordable price you know I do

everything Hands-On and very custom

wardrobes so if you know like the price

of fashion like it's very expensive you

know doing everything by yourself so the

fact that you know joining she and X

they're able to scale and offer your

products you know at a very affordable

price so that's been really helpful so

we haven't had to Pivot like design wise

if anything it's kind of an extension

yeah very nice I love each of your

different outlooks on this as well I

know we have a lot of creatives in the

audience today and tuning in so

something I find very helpful

um as a creative myself is you know a

lot of the times we think it's such an

easy Road it's super perfect to just get

to the success that you're at and if you

haven't any hurdles you're not going to

get over them because everyone else had

it so much easier so what I would love

to know are what are some of the biggest

struggles you have faced getting into

this career path and how have you

overcome them I'll start with you Kenya

well I could say a whole lot of things

can be hurdles I can say being a five

foot black woman is a hurdle all by

itself but I could also say that

I am one that beyond what what would be

considered a hurdle rather that is who I

am whether that is the money that I have

in my bank account I have identified

that being a fashion designer is who I

am and what my purpose is and because I

have identified that being a fashion

designer who my purpose is and I walk in

that every single day the doors are

going to open because that is the

assignment that has been put on me

now because I believe that I don't have

to go and seek this I I did not reach

out to Xi'an Xi'an has reached out to me

and that's a lot of my brand

Partnerships there's a lot of things

that I feel like when you're doing like

that thing that's yours you don't really

have to fight that hard to get it you

might have to fight a little bit hard to

sustain it but you don't have to fight

hard to get it and I think that for me

um it's kind of

you know what I'm saying like it's just

a natural flow of things I don't believe

in doors closing

um because I always feel like when

something you know what I'm saying when

something closes another one opens

I just feel like what's mine is mine

like yeah you can't you it's nothing you

can do to take it or people say well you

give away so much information I can give

you I can go live every day and let you

see everything that I'm doing but like

you're not gonna do me how I'm gonna do

me

so I don't care to share the information

with you I'm not that gate keeper that's

like oh I'm not going to tell you where

I get my linen from and my zippers you

can have it

What You Gonna Do With It

I can have it but I don't feel like

there are any things I feel like again

like what I'm going to have I'm gonna

have it but my job is to stay consistent

to keep moving to stay true to the

fashion designer that I am and

everything that I want is going to

present itself as long as I keep

traveling down my road is this fashion

designer that I am

yes

absolutely I think that's an amazing way

of looking at it I have to or you're

gonna die being a fashion design is hard

you be broke you'd be like oh my God

where I'm gonna get money from do I buy

fabric do I pay bills like if you just

it'd be decisions yeah for real yeah

all of that where's the wine

Valerie how about you what what are some

of the biggest obstacles you've had to

face

it's about all of that everything Kenya

said you know the struggle is real when

you're an independent designer with no

Capital

um it's really hard you know it might be

glamorous it might look like oh it's

something I want to pursue but it takes

a certain character you know to push

through the struggles because there's

highs and lows it's like a roller

coaster you know you'll have something

that goes viral and then you'll have

moments of you know quiet and you know

it's hard but um you got to make the

struggle look sexy you gotta you know

keep pushing and um the same thing you

know it highs and lows and um

I don't know I just think that you have

to stay true to yourself and for every

no that you get because it's difficult

you know trying to break through into an

industry that's very saturated you know

for every no there's going to be a yes

you know there might be 50 no's but

there might be 10 yeses and the same

thing if you keep doing you and you're

authentic to yourself those doors will

open and opportunities will definitely

greet you and yeah and then everything

will just move forward and push forward

but it's never going to be an easy Road

there will always be obstacles

um you just have to you know know how to

get over the bumps there's always going

to be bumps in the road and it's like no

big deal you know you know what my big

experience is

to know like it's not the no right I'm

used to the no yes but it is what

happens when I stop saying yes to myself

like what's on the other side of that

like I fought so hard to be where I am

and God knows where I'm going right so

but what if I stopped today right like I

can tell you 30 million ways to like

take 20 and what to do with it but what

I don't know is like what does that

yacht look like what does that private

island look like what does retiring my

mama look like and if I stop today I

won't know what that what that means I

don't slept girl let me tell you I slept

on the floor in my studio with my back

hurting and I had a client that's gonna

meet me there at 8 30 so I gotta clean

up go to the grocery store and take a

whole bath and then come back and act

like I just got there when she got there

like no I did all that stuff exactly so

like if I stop now like was it all in

vain

I like my own show girl when you're

talking about bird baths I had an

electric kettle that was my shower that

was my hot shower so sleeping in a

studio we slept in our showroom and

that's how we operated for the longest

time but here we are so it's never in

vain the struggle is never in vain and

you I love I'm going to steal this but

make the struggle look sexy I love that

so much uh Armand how about you

I mean everything you guys said I agree

but I also want to say the biggest

artist that ever existed you know they

always come from a dark place they all

struggle they all had like a difficult

childhood so I think that can easily

become like a source of inspiration and

a source of strength so yeah

but the struggle the biggest struggle

definitely is

um to stand out as a brand

um there's so many Brands every day

somebody is launching something new so

how do you stay relevant to to yourself

and what you do and stay unique while

still standing out and and sell in the

end of the day for me one of the biggest

challenges especially being based in the

Middle East where everything is very

restricted so sometimes that can affect

the creativity as well so you're like

stuck in a box and everything is a don't

so how do you step out of that box

create something that you're proud of

that people are going to like as well so

that has been one of the challenges for

me

thank you so much for sharing uh Armand

looking back at your career path is

there anything you would have done

differently or that you wish you could

do again

um I don't think so I think everything

happens for a reason so I think I've

learned a lot and sometimes I look at

some of my pieces I created a couple

years ago and I'm like what was I

thinking you know but at the time I

thought that was the right thing so yeah

I don't think I would have changed

anything

that's a good answer good answer I I

definitely feel you in the you know

everything happens for a reason mindset

I know how about you Kenya is there

anything looking back at your career you

would have done differently or that you

wish you could do again I would have

hired a CPA from the beginning

um don't overlook the money people they

are your friend their friend they will

help you no I don't think I would change

anything I think that every struggle

hurdle exciting moment sad moment

fantastic moment has um taught me

something that I could take to where I

am in the next my next Journey yeah but

get that CPA and get that attorney for

real

um you need contracts and you need a

money person for real even if it's five

dollars somebody need to show you how to

manage it and that attorney needs to put

a contract on it

good advice as well uh Valerie how about

you

I honestly think I should have taken

fashion a little more seriously because

it was a hustle for me for the longest

time I was like oh making my money on

the side so I would say you know taking

it a little more seriously earlier on

you know because I was going to school

to be an educator and I wanted to teach

so you know maybe I can merge the two

someday you know the fashion and the

education so

absolutely uh something I would love to

know from each one of you uh for anyone

out there trying to get into this career

field whether they're just starting out

in the she and X program or maybe they

haven't even gotten to that point just

yet but they're trying to figure things

out what is one piece of advice you

would offer someone out there watching

I'll start with you Armand

um I mean it's very cliche but just be

yourself

um make your brand speak out for

yourself like for example when I see

each of you girls uh I can see your

brand in you as well I can see it in

your personality I can see it in your

personal style so I think that's

important for you to have your own

unique style and just stick to it but

also

um I feel like starting a brand is just

not about it's not only about creating

you have to do the marketing yourself

you have to do the social media

sometimes and I think that's a that's a

big part as well you have to think as a

businessman and then you have to think

as an artist if you're lucky for

somebody else to do that for you hey but

most of the time that's not that's not

the case so

yeah

and how about you Valerie

definitely I

as a designer and a business you are

wearing so many hats you know and that's

something that I kind of struggle with a

little bit is you know doing the

business and the marketing you know

designing pattern making everything so

I would definitely give advice to you

know delegate things but also first and

foremost keep it real with yourself you

know be authentic tell your story don't

try to be something you're not you know

you you have your own identity and

fashion is an expression an extension of

that so you know just make sure along

your journey that you're just you're

keeping it real and I think that will

take you so far in life if you're just

being authentic like 100 genuine and um

I think that's how you'll stand out in a

Marketplace is just being yourself being

bold being rebellious challenging things

and being disruptive in the fashion

industry and that would be my advice

absolutely I think that's really great

advice and how about you Kenya

um

don't stop uh don't stop and don't stop

again I don't care if you sleeping on

the floor if you're couch surfing if

designing is who you are and is and is

really who

in your gut and you wake up in the

morning and you love it and you cry as

much as I do about fashion don't stop I

don't care what it looks like just

simply don't stop if you don't have a

pattern maker guess what you got the

good will Autumn clothes in there break

them suckers apart lay them down iron

them lay them out flat you just got a

whole pattern shop right there you need

a website developer you need somebody to

do like create you a pitch deck or

whatever Fiverr get it go it's it's ways

to go about all things the barter system

everything but whatever you have to do

make it work but don't stop the

consistency for me is what I feel like

is keeping me going the consistency and

knowing that I can wake up every day and

I feel in my heart of hearts I am really

doing what I am called to do is the one

thing that I can wake up every day and

say that I am filled with gratitude and

I'm grateful for because I am walking

this Earth doing what I think is my

thing and regardless of how much money I

have that it is an emotional experience

for me because I'm excited about that

and it takes and I know it's going to

take me uh to where I need to be but

please don't stop I don't care what nope

my mama

and my grandmother did not understand

nothing about what I was doing they

would see me creating and sewing but

they were like but so and so was hiring

down the street

and I'm like but I don't want to work

their job I would literally rather sleep

in my car I work jobs when I would sit

in the car and I would cry I had a job

and I would go early so I can sit in my

car and cry for 30 minutes get myself

together and then go inside I don't want

that for anybody to want that for myself

I'm not saying quit your job I'm just

saying figure it out give the same

energy that you can give a job give that

to yourself at the same time but please

don't stop don't stop it is worth it the

struggle is worth it the things on the

other side of the struggle is worth it

because you just never know where you

are and then you give up and then you'll

be like man was it all in vain but if I

would have just did it one more time and

then that door will open and that door

will open and that door will open

because for me my grandmother told me at

one time she said

fashion for you is going to be a

Ministry for you it's not just going to

be about the clothes you're going to be

able to tell who you are in your story

to the masses and they're going to say

okay if she can do it a little ball hit

black girl can do it then I can do it

too you know what I mean and it and it

did it is for me it has become what I

consider my Ministry because now we have

a 501c3 day camp for kids that we're

kicking off next year

and

I have another one like because I was

literally the starving artist so like

hopefully by 2024 because we're trying

to find a building we want to create a

residential house for artists and it is

a two-year residency where artists get

to live there totally for free while

they're creating their next project

whether that's a designer rather than

music

it becomes like whatever their art is

and where not only that to bring in

people who are excelling at that to help

them take it to the next level so we can

bring in the next group of people

because I learned it's not just about us

like we have these gifts and these gifts

I suppose and we are supposed to take

these gifts and pour into other people

because it's not I didn't get here and

where I'm going I don't know I'm excited

about where I'm going but I didn't get

here by myself so I know that it's my

responsibility to take someone else with

me and do what I can and I asked all the

time like with the I'm just a little

girl that know how to sew but what can I

do to take that to the next level who

can I enrich who cannot touch what can I

do and that's where all these uh

non-profits came from but the

residential house was important for me

because I'm like if I would have when

you're trying to create and you broke

them designs don't come together

you can't think that skirt is just not

cute enough when the lights is out

and so to give creators that space but

um

I'm just excited I'm just happy to be

here y'all

well we are so excited to have all of

you and also such great advice all

around so thank you so much for sharing

I know I feel very inspired

um each of you have built your own

Brands and I know a lot of us out here

are trying to build our own brand so

what what would you say is important

when building one's brand I'm gonna

start with you Armand

uh I think I mentioned it before as well

it's just uh the identity of the brand

is just about uh you speaking out to the

customers and you staying unique to

yourself and creating my brand is still

evolving I'm still trying to figure out

myself I'm still trying to shape up my

brand and give it some identity so I'm

still learning uh and when I'm ready I

I'm gonna know I'm I'm gonna know I'm

I'm ready to just start my own brand so

yeah very nice thank you and Valerie how

about you I'm totally agree like as you

move along this process you're

constantly learning you know what's

important to your brand I feel like you

have to really pay attention

um to feedback you know from your

customers what they want

um but also again going back to being

authentic to your own style your own

unique identity

and that will extend all the way to you

know the customers you have it's like a

magnet your identity becomes a magnet

for other people that identify with your

story with your brand your creativity so

as long as you're speaking truthfully

you know from your own experience I feel

like that will resonate with other

people so again just the most important

thing for a brand is keeping it real

just just be the most real you know with

yourself and very well said Thank you

and Kenya how about you

um I would say uh definitely keeping it

real

um just knowing who you are as a brand

and that brand identity but before you

become a brand because I have learned to

think from a business point of view

um secure your brand

um you know not just on GoDaddy and

getting the website but go to the USPTO

if you got to get an attorney lock your

stuff down if you can and look at it

from that I got a cease and desist which

is a kind of a blessing for me

um early on because I had a whole nother

name I thought I was rocking it and then

they were like oh no ma'am that's hours

and I didn't do my homework I was I

didn't know any better and so but Sylvia

Molly was the best name that I could

have ever gotten that represents my

family but

um just doing that and just

do it it don't have to be perfect you

don't have to have a perfect website you

don't have to have a perfect collection

you can drop one skirt

you can draw one they don't know that it

ain't produced it could be one skirt and

then you got 10 orders and then you'd be

like okay girl you're gonna help me make

these 10 skirts like whatever you have

to do just do it don't wait for the

perfect situation to actually launch

that brand because people launching

Brands every day and a lot of the brands

that you think got their stuff together

don't have their stuff together you know

you got major brands that are making

millions and dollars and they still do

pre-sale when they can just go ahead and

just push that stuff out if they wanted

to but just do it I think my biggest

thing is do it there is no perfect way

to do it I'm I mean we're all learning

as we go every single day

um but just do it I think a lady I made

a dress for this lady one time and um

she came to pick it up but the dress was

too tight because she told me that she

was a 10 but she was a 16. it was a mess

right you know what I'm talking about

so she said well I'll come and I'll come

back and get it when I can fit it so

then two days later I get like a thing

from PayPal and PayPal was like your

customer said they never received a

dress and I was like

she lying but you know on PayPal there

is no section to say she lying

it was either did you ship it or not but

I'm like but she came in there to get it

and then she messaged me and she said I

hope that you learned a valuable lesson

from that and then the emotional part of

me was going to be like

but then I had but then I messaged back

and I said you know what I did and that

was the day when I got like nda's work

for hires agreements contracts or this

whatever everything is a Learning lesson

but just don't stop don't give up it

don't have to be perfect just go out

there and be the best designer that you

want to be I am so whatever you want to

call me and you need me to be like what

is you doing just do it again there's

just no perfect way to do it just do it

make the dress make the skirt it could

be ugly somebody gonna buy it it's a

customer for everything

I love it I love it also great advice I

I just feel that throughout the theme of

yeah just do it no matter what it is get

it done I love it so much

um I know we're nearing the end of our

panel but I I want to hear from each of

you do you have any exciting projects

coming up whether it's I don't know

maybe she an ex related or otherwise

Valerie I'll start with you

have coming up next is my next Sheen

drop which is going to be for the girls

I'm like I'm sorry so I gotta do

something for the girls that look like

me and like I said um we are rebranding

as a brand so Sylvia Molly is getting

rid of all of our small sizes I'm sorry

space and I think that it is something

that I am beyond excited about I wake up

in the morning be like oh the girls is

going to be so fly I really wake up like

that and I really feel like

I mean I know that's supposed to be a

fashion designer but I really for the

first time really feel like

that size in that space is mine I really

feel like I'm really truly have found my

path and I think that all the girls that

represent in that 10 to 20 space

um

is going to be exciting and so hopefully

you know that product and development

phase is long getting them patterns

right and trying to adjust to a curvier

body is different I mean I can talk to

plus size

social media

into this with women who have already
done this so successfully so please okay

most creative and expressive ways
welcome to the stage Joseph Josephine is a model and content creator who has walked countless runways since she made her Runway debut back in 2011 and she is amassed an impressive audience on social media of over 8.2 million followers all right she's the co-founder of Jojo an activewear brand an online community dedicated to sharing workouts and health routines with like-minded followers next we have Yvette EXO an entrepreneur co-founder of two clothing brands Act of Faith and EXO as well as being the CEO of her own Cosmetics brand

I I don't think anyone thought social

media was going to be as industry

important and as brand as important as

it is now so I mean if you scroll down

to my very very early Instagram it had

these weird frames and filters and

you're just kind of having fun and my

friends like do that selfie thing and

I'm like what is this thing gonna make

me sound really old but it was just like

a fun space for me I just had fun with

it so this was like wait it was like

2013. I think I started 14 I started

around the same time I had a fashion

blog so a website when people were

actually reading blogs you know so I

started there and then I started to move

everything over to Instagram around

2014.

wearing and it kind of just took off

from there

I mean God like it's been crazy just to

see how social media has evolved from 10

years ago you know where we are now and

you know looking at Snapchat filters to

like now just trying to be as real as

possible so just just being at the

Forefront of them seeing how that grows

it's been huge awesome no

for people who are just starting what

would be the best piece of advice that

you guys could give them in terms of how

do you

get the attention of an audience

probably authenticity just staying true

to yourself and

um I feel like it's a little bit more

saturated now where we're finding it a

little bit more difficult to grow but

definitely staying true to yourself

because overall what you might be able

to offer somebody is not what somebody

else is offering someone else so you're

always going to be able to stand out in

that crowd

another thing it's really important to

find your Niche like if you're just

sharing everything at all times so it's

not really like

a guideline or a wheeze now I feel like

followers or communities want like a

reason like what are you actually

offering so I've always looked at like

boxes for me it's like

you can have two you can have three you

can have I have five that I usually

rotate between so like even with the

days I'm like I don't know what to post

about I kind of go back to like my

default setting like I post about

fashion okay I post about you know sport

I post about so find your Niche where

you feel strong in that but be authentic

to you and your reality because if you

have to like make it to make it then

it's like it doesn't really work on

social media the same way and

consistency I think is like one of the

biggest ones I know I should take my own

advice sometimes it's really hard to

stay consistent but I feel like you know

posting at least once a day or even

twice a day sometimes is just so

important along with being authentic and

you know Finding Your Niche and being

consistent I think because the

algorithms really yeah

punish you if you don't or consistent

always they want you to be on there all

time as much as that can sound like a

lot it really is just I think it's

looking at it as part of your job or

part of your everyday life like okay you

wake up what's like part of your morning

routine well it's either get ready go

get make content or have something to

share it really is has to be an

extension of your brand at this point

and I think more than anything too is

like testing and learning because you

know you get to kind of see you know

what is my audience like and what do

they engage with and then continue

amazing now as you guys all started you

know right before social media was

completely saturated

when did it become intentional for you

guys when did it become like okay this

is something serious that I can actually

use as a business

for me it was the first time like I've

been modeling for over a decade now and

you used to be able to like you had to

like walk around to clients knock on

their door and basically show you show

them this book of what you've done like

it was very like old school and I would

walk around like to 20 different people

a day just in the hopes of getting a job

and I remember the first time I sit down

and they're like no no I don't need to

see your book can you pull your phone

out and I was like what do you mean my

phone they're like yeah can I see your

feed and that's when I was like oh it's

not just my mom and my friends looking

it's actually the industry is keeping an

eye on it and that really pivoted my

whole like way of thinking and I was

like oh I really have to like maybe

think about what I put out there

um and it just from there on I could

just see such a change in the industry

um what they perceive what they see and

then Brands like I mean it's been the

last like five years I would say like

people really sell and do things and

like you can really curate for Brands

now on there right

yeah I think in the beginning for us I

remember me having conversations and

people actually like well what is it

that you do or that's fun that's a nice

hobby or oh that's cute you just talked

you know on online to people and I feel

like it was that transition when people

actually started noticing like oh this

is what you're doing or this is

um actually creating like an income for

you or it's becoming like an actual job

that transition has been even a little

still till this day because now when I

say oh like I am on social media you

kind of have a little bit more respect

as opposed to before it was like a cute

hobby before it now it's like okay

you're an influencer like it's actually

a job so that was definitely the

transition for me

I think it was around 2015 or 16 I

actually got hired by guests to create

content for their social media so I was

posting guests and then they actually

hired me to create content for their

social media and their website so I do a

lot of content creation for Brands where

I actually don't post on my own platform

I create for them so that they can use

and that I think was the pivotal moment

for me where I was like okay this is

like turning into a business and it was

about 2015 or 2016. wow and that was

like one of the biggest companies that

like that I worked with back then and

that's just kind of how it kept going

that's why I was like okay this is this

is crazy this is like a big brand and I

have to make it a full-time business

and now what are some things you guys

wish that you knew before you got on

social

that the internet is forever yeah

I mean probably for me just taking that

leap of faith of understanding that it

was actually real I I had a normal you

know corporate nine to five and I feel

like taking that step of like okay I'm

committing and I'm gonna do this full

time and this is the risk that I'm

taking that kind of did it for me I

think the same for me that it was going

to be almost full-time 24 7 and I wish I

knew that there was going to be a lot of

anxiety that came with being on social

media all the time and like I think the

mental health thing for me I wish I knew

which just kind of like I've been doing

it for so long now that you're just you

know kind of not stuck but you were I

wish I knew that there was just so much

it's all evolving and developing and I

think the mental health it's because

it's you do it from the more the moment

you wake up to the moment you go to

sleep like there's just no time and

you're just consumed in it you know 24 7

sometimes you don't even realize it so I

wish I knew that we would be so sucked

in like it's hard to separate real life

and but I think that's why for me it's

been really important to have certain

like lines that I don't cross for myself

and for me it's like I chose to be on

there I chose to be online my family or

friends did not so for me the clear line

is yes I am exposing myself to this I

understand the consequences but like as

much as my mom wants to be like a public

profile and like attack me I'm like you

don't get it that's not the consequences

you want in there yeah

yeah I think it's also knowing when to

take a break yeah too and I think like

that's something that I wish I knew and

you know sometimes I have to remind

myself as well you know like I'll have

my phone out and my husband will be like

again and I'm and you know it just like

sometimes you're so sucked in and you're

so drawn into what's happening in that

world you also have to live in the

present world too yeah it gives you

almost like an adrenaline rush

especially when you can be like creative

too so yeah it's creating those

boundaries like with the platform but

also when you like love something so

much you don't even realize that you're

consumed so much in it I know with me

it's so hard to shut off because I feel

like there's always an idea there's

always something that I could be doing

there's always something that like I'm

trying to do so it's really hard for me

personally to just kind of like not be

thinking about it because it's something

that I genuinely do enjoy even though it

can be draining I love it so much that's

what's good to have like friends or

family sometime and listen when they say

hey

I'm also like can we pay attention to me

for me it's it's helped a lot to like

compartmentalize the hours like almost

like look at it as work sometimes in the

sense as much as schedule yeah as much

as fun like oh but on this day I'll book

the whole day out to like do all these

different scenarios so like that gives

my give me like time or

not panning about not capturing A Moment

Like if you're on vacation you're having

fun like oh my God this would be so

great for social this would be a

beautiful

and you forget to actually experience

the moment like yeah give yourself two

minutes take the picture if you get it

cool if you get the tick tock dope if

not move on like it's not the end of the

world it's worse to miss out on like

life we're not saving lives is what I

mean I like to bring it in reel it in

well it's something that you guys all

started out from coming from a place of

love coming from a place of you know

this is something that you enjoy

personally when did you decide okay this

is

I want to make this a brand I want to

actually have a brand that is

on social as well how did that sort of

realization come to YouTube

for me it was like I've again worked in

the modeling industry and I've kind of

been a hanger my whole life I didn't

have like much of a say I just showed up

and I was the face of everybody else's

brand where the social media was the

only way I could show me or show this

behind the scenes of what I did when I

wasn't working so I had a lot of fun

with showing what the fashion industry

is about about when you're not just on a

Runway when you're not just on a post

they're super edited and like I could

walk around but it also like was weird

because I signed up for this Anonymous

industry that nobody really

new urama like people don't really like

now it's like blasted all over but I

like taking that charge and I feel like

it helped me take charge of my own

career because I could be like

show what my hobbies are I could show

what I care about I can show what I and

that made sense because all of a sudden

Brands see what you actually care about

it and the collaboration with other

brands made a lot more sense because

they were authentic to you and not just

like oh you look like it you could fit

but I actually have an interest in now

in what the brand is it's you as a

person versus you as a model yeah I

prefer it a lot more I think it's a lot

more fun having someone of us saying and

things I mean I feel like it's also like

your own brand and I think that's like

the most amazing part of all the

platforms is that you can create that

yourself and no one's telling you what

it has to be like

um with me I definitely feel like it's

also longevity just knowing that I have

something to also build and fall back on

as well I feel like when I first started

I wasn't sure how far it was going to

take me or how long I was going to do it

for if I wanted to step back and you

know not just do the Social Media stuff

I could so by building a brand I felt

like that was going to be my outlet to

the day that I decide like okay I don't

want to do social media anymore I still

have my brand to kind of fall back on

and still do what I love and still enjoy

what I'm doing

yeah I think for me when I I really love

travel and fashion so it was just

building my brand on like what I love to

do and what I think I like I would want

to see so I

know now how do you sort of get to the

point where you're building a brand

identity you know you have your brand

how do you decide okay this is how I

want to represent myself online this is

what I want to sort of you know

be in terms of my Pub the public

perception of who I am and this is how

I'm going to use social media in order

to do it so Josephine I mean it was

definitely a privilege switch of being

like just a person who posts and then

looking at yourself almost from the

outside and be like okay if like you

have a brand I have a brand as well but

being your own brand you kind of have to

look at the same way

you have to look at it critically you

have to be like what do I set up for

what do I not what is my values what do

I bring to the table what are the

conversation I shouldn't be part of and

why the conversation and then take you

to this take your stance on certain

things and or decide not to so for me it

was like a very like internal like

marketing conversation with myself and

like almost looking at like a product

and like I've seen I know I've been a

product my whole life like I'm a model

being a hanger so my mom always said

this thing when I was younger because it

was kind of weird being judged for my

looks every time you get a no it felt so

personal and she was like well

think about this

your shampoo and I was like where are we

going with this but everybody has

different hair types everybody somebody

wants it foamy somebody wants a fruity

somebody wants it for you know hair

coloring somebody want natural

that doesn't mean any of those shampoo

or bad they're just not the right fit so

for me it's like I was trying to figure

out what shampoo on the Shelf am I and

and stick to that

um so I could also attract the right

kind of clients so

when you're true to your own brand and

you stick and you figure it out and it

it doesn't come overnight it's not like

I'm expecting everybody to know exactly

like if I hand the mic over what's your

brand but if you have this internal

conversation with yourself like your

value and kind of like

step it back a little bit and look at it

as a yourself as a product it really

helped me yeah I think it's just

something that happens over time too and

you just figure it out it's not like

something that you like come up with

overnight and you just kind of test the

waters and what you are authentic to you

know and also just knowing your audience

I feel like you want to be able to come

out with a product that is going to make

sense like me I started in the fashion

beauty industry so I wouldn't

necessarily start like a cooking you

know wear brand or anything like that

and if questions are being asked I'm

gonna know that I'm I'm gonna know the

answer to it and I'm not I'm not just

doing it for the money or to start a

business or start a brand but because

one I genuinely love it and I'm good at

it and I know that I can actually

come out with a good product because

it's something that I'm comfortable with

yeah you kind of see like what your

audience is like drawn to and what

they're really loving and then that's

when you kind of build your brand

identity and focus on that but sometimes

you can also get audience like you

didn't necessarily ask for so there's

also like that like for me transitioning

from like modeling to brand

I mean I was an underwear model for a

long time so like definitely have more

male followers than I expected yeah

which makes sense but for me it's like

having to Pivot and like still deciding

to talk mainly to my female followers

also is kind of like can feel like a

setback at times because you're not

catering so it's also like you want to

cater to the followers you want not

necessarily always to the ones you have

because they might not be right for

where you want to take either your

personal brand or the brand you were

you're coming out with there's so many

things to it so again knowing what your

product is I think is more important

than necessarily always following what

your audience wants because there's a

huge difference there was when I came

out with my fitness brand there's a huge

difference in who our customer was and

who our community was there's a great

overlap but there's definitely also

surprisingly a data we were like there

was full customers we weren't like

aware of was there because our community

was a lot younger and we surprisingly

had also an older audience and like our

actual customer so that surprised us

because we like fully went the first

campaign going like oh we're gonna go

for like younger this this is a

demographic and then we realized and it

pivoted yeah and sometimes you learn

from that too yeah so like sometimes

you'll push out a product that not

necessarily hits the audience that you

typically have but then you reach a

different audience and you're like oh oh

my God like now I have another audience

and I can tap into that as well so

that's you know from the brand

perspective like we're always thinking

you know how can we experiment too like

maybe there's something that hasn't been

done before and that might be a surprise

and Delight for our audience and maybe

new people as well no I mean Erica from

a business perspective like how what are

some best practices that you know young

designers can use to really shape you

know their brands on social

I think like the the biggest bottom line

is there's no one way for anybody like

you know there's not like one size meets

all everybody has a unique voice and I

think it's tapping into that and what

makes you special and you know yourself

better than anybody else does and I

think it's highlighting that and I think

once you know what that is and once you

know what resonates with your audience

and just staying true to yourself

that makes much stronger I would say

best practice by each platform and again

like each platform has a different type

of audience so you know Facebook is

generally an older

demographic uh Snapchat very young uh

Instagram is probably a millennial like

myself

and then Tick Tock you know that's where

you can have a lot of fun so I think

everybody is on Tech talk but

um it's it's all it's all up to you

I mean do you guys see a big difference

in terms of your follower groups based

on the platform

yeah I feel like even with the platforms

I don't know if any of you guys feel

like this but I definitely feel like I

also have like different Vibes for each

platform like when I think about my

Instagram it's kind of like put together

a little bit more but my Tick Tock just

seems like I show my personality a bit

more just like I would on YouTube so I

think it's just definitely also learning

the platform and the audience that's on

the platform for you to be able to

really just

be who you are on there but I I've

noticed that with the new platforms that

I have been

um on that I kind of like I'm a little

more particular like okay maybe I

shouldn't post that on Instagram but

like it's totally okay for me to put it

on put it on Tick Tock

um but I think it's just learning that

specific platform I think that's like

key too is that content on a certain

platform does not belong across the

board so it's being very specific to

each audience and each platform and I've

noticed too even with when I when I

tried to like it's great to recycle

obviously your content and everything

because you want to be able to to do

that but anytime I post something on

Tick Tock it makes sense but then the

moment I post it on Instagram everyone's

kind of like oh what is this or why did

you post that or it's like a little

cringy or like it just you have to learn

the platform that you're do you find

that Instagram's like more curated and

it's just more like you want it to look

perfect yeah as opposed to like on Tick

Tock like I can wake up without makeup

on my YouTube I can wake up I feel like

it's pivoting though yeah it's first

pivoting a little bit more

in order for it to still continue to be

a good platform I feel like they're

starting to now be a little bit more

like okay like I'm starting to

understand it but I personally because

I've been doing it for so long I feel

like that transition has been a little

bit more harder for me for me to just

actually

uh me not cringe what I'm looking at I'm

like okay maybe I shouldn't but just

learning the platforms and just actually

knowing what you're wanting to do in

each one because at the end of the day

they're also different I don't know like

it's like a different audience too that

you're kind of gravitating towards right

I mean one of the things I love about

your content is that your entire family

is there and some they sneak peek in

some of the content how do you navigate

that I mean my whole life has been on

social media might be a little bit

different from your guys's experience

but I've started and I share everything

and I feel like that's been a little

harder for me to transition because I'm

not just a brand I'm kind of like you

know I had a lot of my audience based

off of showing everything you know like

I've showed mom life I've showed my

struggles I've shown like it's been very

raw I don't do a lot of the perfect

editing or anything like that so

navigating it's more difficult back to

her with the mental health stuff just

having people have too many opinions

sometimes because

you can talk about me or like have an

opinion about me but then you know how

she was mentioning about her mom like

sometimes they don't understand that

what comes with everything you know like

I can pose my husband and then now he's

involved in something that he didn't ask

for you know like he didn't ask to be on

that platform but

um I mean it's been great too though

because I feel like I have a genuine you

know relationship with all of the people

who support me like whenever I do

anything I know that they're looking at

me they're like oh my God I'm genuinely

so proud of you because they've watched

me grow from you know 20 years old to

where I'm at now I'm gonna talk about

each but where I'm at now and all the

years and all the growth has been

amazing but it just it comes with a lot

for sure wow I mean how do all of you

guys balance that sort of connection

with your followers because they are

very invested they follow you you know

through the years they know the ins and

outs of your career in your life like

what is that aspect of being on social

like

I mean I think I'm I'm pretty authentic

online but it's probably just 20 of who

I am privately I think it's important

for me to keep a line like I I love to

show what I do at work I love to show a

lot of like what my life entails yet my

private life for me that has been like

unless somebody has decided to be in

Social like my husband is on a social so

I feel comfortable with him the friends

I have that is on a social feel

comfortable with them but

I just know my friend group and my

family from home haven't decided so for

me that's my line and like for me that's

not my mitigation but it's different for

everybody and I also think I mean I know

because both me and my husband and

social that day where kids come along

that's also going to be a conversation

do you share that do you not and then

where is that line they can't really

answer and I think you you know best as

a parent what works for you and your

family but yeah I think it's it's

important to or it's been for me to have

days where I'm just like not in like

content creator or I'm just me

well you get to choose you know I think

that's what's the great part about the

platform is that you get to choose what

you want to show and you know

I mean like my natural state is to

always pull out my phone and capture

things but it's deciding is this

something that everybody needs to see or

is it something that I just want to

remember myself

I feel like that with with a lot of the

stuff that I do too I feel like I've

always tried to be very

to just the makeup and the fashion as

well though whenever I do posts like you

hardly actually will see any like actual

mom content like I don't do like the mom

vlogging and the mom you know I post my

kids occasionally but

it's that barrier of I don't want

opinions on how I'm parenting or how I'm

raising my kids or how like because I

feel like that's just a different

conversation but just trying to balance

to make sure that people don't forget

how I started like what led me to where

I'm at now and it was usually it was the

Beauty and the fashion stuff

now I know that you guys didn't

necessarily start out with the goal of

growing followers but tell me a little

bit about how once you really sort of

you know stepped into okay I'm going to

turn this into an actual business how

did you go about sort of building an

audience and growing that audience

I think like it all starts with you know

asking your audience what do they want

to see so you know the audience starts

small no matter what you have to start

somewhere no matter what

um and then as you see more people

following you're like okay well I think

I understand what my audience likes

sometimes they won't like something and

that's okay and you can pivot from that

and you can learn from that and that's I

think that's the key is just

continuously learning and your audience

also continuously evolves so it's just

growing and evolving with your audience

and making sure that you're staying true

to your brand and making sure that like

whatever piece of content that you're

creating actually accentuates what

you're trying to you know give out

I was doing a lot of cross promotion

with um you know other influencers and

bloggers and Brands I feel like that

really helped me grow a following like

just you know my friends who were doing

the same things as me and like-minded

individuals we were you know traveling

together shooting together and doing all

that kinds of stuff so I felt like that

really helped my following grow a lot in

an organic way I also find that works

with Brands like yeah like I feel like

when you collaborate with other brands

or just like cross mode lift each other

up and like if you find like-minded

Brands doing like collaborations makes a

lot of sense or even just like

have an event or do something together

or like yeah share each other highlight

yeah yeah it helps a lot

no each of you is a brand owner when it

came time to you know

launch your Brands how did you go about

developing the social strategy

like with JoJo when it was time for

launch like what was the

um

you know initial social strategy and how

has that evolved over time we actually

created the social platform way before

we created a brand we were a fitness

Community just sharing that we were

working out me and my best friend and

just like sharing like the commitment of

having someone to be in the gym with you

because for me that's always the hardest

part is feeling like motivated so having

someone else who are like accountable

really helped and that we shared that

and we shared partner workouts and

realized oh people also like to have

accountability and like they found other

people and then we were a social media

platform for

three or four years before we build a

brand and it actually was like oh here

might be something and the community

asked for stuff so we're like oh we

could turn this into a bread

what was really hard was like how do you

then take that Community turn into a

brand without fully forgetting the

community but also knowing like hey we

are also a shoppable brand now we aren't

just like the social media platform so

that was that's something we're still

learning every day and like each

campaign is new and different and we're

pivoting constantly different like my

partner just gave birth three weeks ago

so that is also like a whole new chapter

we're adding on to the social media

platform and just like

you know having a partner and everything

has been super super helpful but yeah no

I think for us it was

showing more of the brand taking people

behind the scenes and then taking the

experience we've had in the industry of

like and finding other brands we love

what they do feel inspired love

Pinterest

um to get inspiration from mood boards

and campaigns and shooting and just it

was also really really fun to be the

creative director of shoots instead of

being in front of their camera so but

being behind the camera while I was

hoping to find it was really challenging

but also super creative and yeah every

day every campaign is different every

because we're still constantly a market

that that's the fun thing about social

media you can really test the waters you

like I said our first campaign came out

way too young and way too like

happy-go-lucky and we're like oh that's

not what they want but that was kind of

what our social media present has been

so realizing okay we're turning into a

little bit more fashion we need a

different more mature concept but on how

do we translate that in with our

community so we're still testing the

waters we've only been out for a year

with the brand

yeah I think with Leo is definitely also

who's who you're trying to Target

um I know with like my cosmetic brand it

was a little bit more fun more flirty I

was trying to Target a specific age

group so I feel like that reflected on

what my social media platform was going

to look like and then as far as like

active faith our clothing brand it was a

little bit more edgy it was a little bit

more mature so it's definitely who we

were trying to Target for the actual

brand

um and also separating myself I feel

like I as you know the person like I can

sit there and and create something that

I think would be great because it's me

but I have to put myself outside of the

box of like who the consumer is and

who's actually going to be purchasing my

brand so that's kind of what strategy we

use

um I was traveling and working with

revolve for a really long time and my

content was very heavily swimmer focused

um so when I started my swimwear brand I

was like okay I want the girl who is

shopping for my brand the one who's

gonna shop on revolve and like my

inspiration was you know just traveling

and like everything like that so I feel

like I got a ton of inspiration from

revolve and now my brand is on revolve

so my social strategy was that

and on the least fun side but coming

into any brand I like to look at the

data because the data is what's going to

really drive and give you an

understanding of you know who your

audience is what kind of content is

performing well what's not performing

well

um and then once you kind of know like

the age group and who they are you can

create that kind of content and like

really shape that strategy of what

you're trying to accomplish

now are you guys

working with a social media manager or

is it are you still doing everything on

your own how does that aspect of things

work because a lot of times I think

people feel that especially some social

media is so personal they have to do

everything themselves so I'm kind of

curious

which

you guys are doing at this moment I'm

still heavily involved in every single

aspect of everything that's coming out

but I do have my team for each brand

just because when you are a brand

yourself as

the influencer the content creator it's

really hard to navigate every single

business or every single

um Instagram every single post but

everything still does get verified

through me but I had to unfortunately

get to a point where you have to let you

know people just help and that was also

something yeah like that was also

something very hard because I feel like

I'm always very like this needs to look

like this or because I know what I want

I want it I know what I want it to look

like I know what the vision is but

sometimes you have to step back and just

let the people who are meant to do the

job do the job I'm still doing mine mine

I'm still doing Natasha swim we will be

pivoting to a social media manager but I

am in control of the Instagram and

everything right now it is becoming very

overwhelming so it's also just finding

the right person that you know works

with you and that can see your vision

and art it's it's really hard

um so yeah I'm doing finding somebody

who actually has love for your brand the

way that you do it's it's that's the

hard part for sure I think that's

certainly key is like the love and the

passion

um just like coming in and like

understanding okay you know it's not

okay I'll just go back a little bit too

social media managers we do everything

so like what what don't we do like you

know

um you know influencers too but like in

the sense of where content creators we

um pull data we you know analyze we make

sure that you know whatever we're

producing actually like makes sense for

the feed

um and then we're taking all that data

we're like all right maybe it didn't

work and then we're like okay well hey

by the way like what do you think about

this piece of content that we have to

pitch you and say hey like is this

something that you think would work on

your feed so

yeah we have to be a little bit of a

jack of all trades I think when you're

and I've noticed too even when I did

take that step back to just kind of

allow people to help my brand definitely

elevate it a lot more because I was so

stuck on wanting things to be done a

certain way that even you don't realize

that by trying to do everything you're

not allowing your brand to grow because

you're just stopping yourself from the

full potential that it could be because

now I have a team who's like oh what do

you think about this what do you think

if we drop this and it just feels nice

to be able to walk in and be like okay I

have ideas I have a strategy and it took

some time though I mean I've had my

brands for quite some time now but

um when you do take that step I I did

notice that it was a big change

um I mean we'll I have maybe like three

or four years I feel like that first

first first or two years yeah I'm in my

first two years yeah you're not gonna

want anybody's opinion or you you know

what your brand is you know what you

what you want for your brand but then

after that it was I have you know I have

three brands so it was so overwhelming

for me to one still be a mom of my third

baby so I'm a wife like it was just a

lot of

to focus on my brand I wasn't giving it

the full attention it deserved and

that's when I felt like I was just being

a little selfish I wasn't allowing

myself to let the brand grow because I

was so stuck with wanting it hard to

balance all of that another thing

there's a huge difference in like my

personal Instagrams which is also kind

of a brand itself that I control but

with JoJo our fitness brand which is not

just mine it's me and my partners we

definitely got someone involved actually

one of our friend who's been she was

actually kind of evolved early on just a

fan of us and like

in the sense of just like always would

work out with us over uh the pandemic

she would help us a lot would you say

coming up with Concept because she's

such a creative like wait you should

come work because you can't just like

have fun with us like we should pay you

to do this

um so that has been super nice to be

able to like hand it over to someone we

fully trust but we still meet like we

still shoot all the content

she gets in she creates it she

represents it back so it's still heavily

involved and like all that stuff but for

me it's you can't physically

do everything and the hardest part is to

let go and ask for help do you feel like

that's also made you stronger and your

brand stronger too by having that help

and leveraging those people it grew up

Brands so much I mean we were kind of

like stuck in that just having someone

coming in with fresh ideas someone

coming in and like because you have to

be so consistent we had to be so

consistent in our own platforms so

sometimes the neglect came to our brand

because oh which one of us just posted

last night or didn't we so now having

someone who makes sure that the content

comes out like daily on time even if

we're in a plane or somewhere

um

at least took the stress away from the

brand our own personal things it's like

a whole different story but when it

comes to the brand

you can't afford

not being on it

100 and I also don't do it alone either

so I have a I have an amazing team so

shout out to the team who helps us

curate all this amazing content

nope how do you measure success what is

success was social media posts mean to

you is it something that gets high

engagement is it something that you feel

resonates with your followers

just on a personal level how do you

define success

it's more of an overall I think it's

hard to save one single post successful

I mean sometimes as a brand you can see

a straight correlation on your Shopify

with a post and actually like what comes

in that feels super successful but

I think relying on each post to feel

like oh that's measurement success it's

gonna

tear you down yeah I think you have to

look at the overall picture I think you

have to look at the long picture and

this is especially when it comes to

brands that are like company You're

Building or if you're designing you want

a new brand out there

it's not an overnight thing like as much

as things look like overnight successes

and like you can go viral on Tick Tock

nowadays and all these things

but it doesn't mean longevity so for me

it's like it's a consistency a constant

going at it and just being like okay

what is the time frame I'm giving myself

okay I'm I am going to commit the next

next X amount of years to do this

because if I think it's just gonna

happen tomorrow you might be very

disappointed

I mean I think success is different for

everybody

um there isn't like I said before one

size fits all like some of us might be

looking for engagement some of us might

be looking for virality which again not

that easy even though it may look like

that

um there's a lot that goes into it

um some might just

want to be up there you know just the

small goals like you know starting from

scratch and getting yourself out there

is huge

um but yeah like honestly like it's

setting those goals and then looking at

it day to day and not going okay oh I'm

not I don't have a million followers or

I don't have like this much engagement

as I want what you have to start

somewhere so like you grow that audience

and you grow that like passionate

audience I think that's where you find

your success especially those where

they're constantly cheering you on I've

seen like a lot of Brands and a lot of

people like grow from small to large

like you know I followed your brand as

well and it's been amazing to see like

where you got where where you Blossom

too like it's huge so it's having that

like audience that supports you and

being authentic to yourself and

authentic to your brand and you're

eventually gonna

get where you want to be yeah I feel

like success for me is just having the

consistency of you know incoming jobs

coming in working with different brands

that I have on my brand like wish list

and stuff and not necessarily like

engagement or following or anything like

that and then you know my my own brand

evolved so I think if I'm like

constantly feeling like I'm growing

Within Myself and I'm getting consistent

work and you know involving with myself

I I feel like that's success and just

starting it in general like taking that

step to actually start the business and

do what you're doing yeah after it yeah

and going after it because I feel like

that everyone's gonna have their own uh

definition to what success is and going

in trying to compare your success with

someone else's it's only going to

that's like the last thing you should do

it's not worth it not just like looking

at yourself and seeing how you're like

not comparing yourself to yourself but

seeing that you're like the feeling that

you're like growing like taking the

initiative starting the business and

posting your first picture and doing

your first campaign like all that's just

going to be evolving to overall success

of what you're trying to accomplish I

mean honestly it takes guts to start so

if you started you're successful

definitely now to that end like what

have been some of your proudest moments

or biggest Milestones that you've

reached in your careers that either came

via social or you know were involving

social

[Music]

okay

um I think for me I mean taking a social

platform that was just a fun idea to

working out and sharing that and like

the day we sat with our first product

like we hadn't even set it out but just

sitting with that product actually like

at the 3pl fully packed and like was

ready to like the first order you know

sending it out and like we were building

most of the brand and like my partner's

kitchen so it's just like sitting there

and folding and that sitting once you go

live you're just like is anyone going to

care and that first order comes in

you're like

that was a crazy high feeling or even

just like when you have your customer

receive their first package and they are

reviewing it and it's great feedback and

it's every all that hard work it's like

the smallest details if they just

noticing like your packaging or like all

those little things just having that

moment of having the consumer being like

Oh my God this is the best thing ever I

love it or I'm obsessed it's like you

know that it was worth all the stress

all the anxiety and yeah like seeing the

hard work you know seeing the people

like in in my brand in my swimwear it

was just like wow people you know I was

just always kind of self-conscious like

are people gonna like it like you know

are they gonna see what I see so I think

just seeing other influencers bloggers

customers everybody you know in the

brand and then seeing it Grow from there

was just very

filling

yeah I think like the bottom line though

even more than just growth is just the

sentiment like if you're seeing that

everyone's like loving what you're doing

then I think that's a win yeah

now what's the biggest challenge of

having a fashion business in 2023

oh the biggest challenge of having a in

having a fashion business in 2023 as a

business owner like what would you say

is

the hardest thing of doing it right now

um for us maybe trying to stand out I

feel like that's been

kind of a little bit of trying to make

sure that you're doing something a

little bit different or you know your

target at the end of the day we're all

targeting you know a lot of the same

people it's just what's gonna set you

apart from everything else

I think for me the most uh well for us

the most challenging I'm based in Miami

and the manufacturers are here in LA and

we've had like a ton of delays with

production and stuff you know from

overseas so that's been really

challenging for me and my brand was

developed all over zoom and all over the

Internet so yeah that's just been very

difficult for me

I mean there's I mean a lot of what they

said as well but I also think

being um the world is so connected and

social media is so worldwide and you

want to be a brand for everybody and the

whole world but we're also shipping out

of LA right now and like so when a

customer calls hey I ordered to Europe

what is bad and I'm like oh you know

that thing to get it out custom

um and that's something you can't

predict you could put on your website

but each country is so different so

few of the labels who've benefited from

his Discerning eyes and his mentoring

support welcome Gary wasser

so what we're going to kick this

conversation off with is about getting

started I think getting started is

probably the most difficult thing for a

lot of us especially creatives when

starting any new project so I want to

start with you Laura uh what have you

learned throughout your career at both

Monsey and Oscar de la Renta about

tackling a new project that has helped

you throughout your career well it's

also like very exciting and refreshing

to start something new

so I always get excited I just don't

know what it will be what I'm gonna be

doing that day so

I actually get bored doing same thing

over and over and that's why I have two

Brands so I can do Oscar and monster and

it actually like really keeps me

refreshed and appreciate each other

project and whenever I do projects

outside of Monster and Oscar I do a lot

of home stuff like cooking projects it

makes me like really be more inspired by

my other jobs too so

I think it's important we wake up every

day and do what we love and it's not

really about

like going to work it's about doing what

you love every day

I love that so much it's true it's true

it's like you know especially when you

embark on something that's creative it's

coming from like the most intimate part

of you right it's it's your art it's

your work

um Maeve let me kick it to you so what

was what would you say was the light

bulb moment for you when starting a

career and how did you know that styling

was where you wanted to go I was just

gonna say there's no way anyone could do

what we do if you really didn't love it

like what you were saying because it's

so hard so

um anyway to answer your question I was

I walked into an internship when I was

17 I was going into fit I grew up in New

York city so I was looking to get into

the industry and I walked into this

internship that by the way I didn't want

to go to and my dad was like if you

don't go you know and I walked in and I

couldn't believe that this was a real

job like that people were on this set

and that this stylist was like here's my

AmEx go to bergdorfs and get every pair

of beige pants you can find in a size

eight you know and I was like what are

you talking about you know I couldn't

believe it I couldn't believe it was a

real thing and it was just that very

first day you know that I knew that that

was my path I didn't know what styling

was this was before social media this

was before Rachel's those you know very

famous show and styling was not

something that people were talking about

in the way that we are you know today

and

the next light bulb moment I had was on

set with

um Robin Marielle who were two stylists

who obviously are still working they're

incredible I was their assistant and it

was the run the sound music video and I

just was like whoa you know like this is

this is it for me you know watching

these incredible artists and watching

this music video be made and just being

the tiniest little fly part of this big

production was just so inspiring and

that was it I just knew I had to be a

part of it yeah it was kind of love at

first sight for me

I feel like that's probably a lot of our

stories right you know it's like you do

it once and it's like oh now I'm hooked

that's what you were saying earlier

laquan when you're talking about getting

your first sewing machine you're like

that's it no I'm in it so I actually

have a question for you too so we heard

a lot about you starting your business

from your creative perspective so I

would love to hear and I'm sure

everybody would too about what it was

like for you when you were really you

know in your stride creatively and had

to start making more business related

decisions you know when was that moment

where you said uh I need help I need

support I need someone else's opinion in

here besides my own yeah I mean I think

that that's definitely it's a great

question because there's so many layers

to

um

transitions you know transitional

periods as a designer and the success I

mean like I at one example like I

previously mentioned in the um last

panel was like you know I had to

somebody had to say you can't sew

everything you can't do it all so then I

sort of had to now merge myself into the

manufacturing space you know and having

those kind of communications with

manufacturers who can basically you know

who's supposed to be replicating the

design the original design that I

created that was just a nightmare within

itself because production's a nightmare

you know manufacturing is a nightmare so

it's trial and error trying to figure

out you know making sure that you're

getting the best quality as possible

um also you know

I mean funding is a major issue it's a

major vital situation as a designer you

know I would get a purchase order from a

retailer and then I would say to myself

how am I supposed supposed to upfront

the cost of this order

um because that's how it works you would

get an order from a store

um and in most cases they will not give

you a deposit it's probably on a net you

know net 60 whatever the payment terms

are and you are supposed you basically

are supposed to be you know upfronting

the cost of production which is

something that is very very difficult

for designers to do

um and so those are so sort of the

moments when I started realizing like I

need to raise capital I need to bring in

extra funds in order to be able to you

know produce if that makes any sense

yeah and so

from that what are those first steps to

even take you know I'm thinking from the

creative side of things you've you've

found your stride you know who you are

you know who your brand is but now it's

like I I don't know how to do that right

so how did you find the tools and

resources to know what the next step was

to fund your business I mean

Gary is just obviously a great example

of that you know we took I remember I

took a meeting my business partner and I

we took a meeting at hilden and we had

stores I had purchase orders but it

almost seemed as though like the volume

wasn't enough you know so then I had to

reach a certain level in order to get

you know the kind of like funding and

capital and support that I needed from

hilden um I mean I think it's about

taking every you know every possible

step as well you know for me like

continuing the custom business

continuing you know the e-commerce

business I mean these are all different

uh different revenue streams that you

know I'm relying on to be able to fund

what I need to fund I hope I'm answering

the question correctly yeah I know

that's very helpful and also you're

teeing up Gary perfectly

um so Gary you know for all the dreamers

in the room with really big Ideas what

can you share about your experience

working with you know prolific creatives

you know like laquan and in taking those

initial steps to starting to make a

profitable business it's really

interesting because everybody in this

industry starts in the same place uh

everybody

I've worked with anyone you can imagine

Michael Kors Marc Jacobs Tommy Hilfiger

etc etc and then all the current

designers they all come to me with the

same issues cash flow

retail distribution should we be d2c

what should my margins be etc etc so I I

think one of the most fundamental uh

things that a brand needs to know is it

needs to know that it is not just art

it's art and commerce it's the

combination of the two so as you design

sure you design for creative and for

beauty

but at the same time you have to edit

you have to think you have to understand

the commercial viability of the product

that you're designing so when I talk

with young designers or any designers

those are the questions I ask you know

do you understand what margin is do you

understand what a cash flow is and I

don't want to bore you with you know the

financial stuff but if you're an

entrepreneur and you're going to run a

business you need to know when you're

going to run out of money you need to

know when you're going to need support

you need to know uh what margin you're

achieving on each product that you sell

that you offer

and you have to think in terms of okay

here's my design it's beautiful it's

gorgeous it's gonna cost me two thousand

dollars to make and I need to retail it

at eighteen hundred dollars that's not

going to work you know go back to the

drawing board so all of these components

figure in to the design process you know

the editing process and you need to

understand all of this stuff and we

don't teach it in schools

not well enough

so it's something that you should

everyone here who has any aspiration to

be an entrepreneur in this industry and

own their own brand and build their own

brand needs to go back and study the

basics of running a business profitably

you know it's it's never oh when I

achieve volume then I'll make money that

that's not the case you have to start

from the very beginning

that's incredibly helpful advice I mean

just those nuggets there of knowing

those first steps to take are so

important um Laura I'd love to ask you

more about this too because you have

such an interesting perspective you know

on kind of both sides of the brand right

you know as a creative director of Oscar

de la Renta I'm assuming you have the

resources at your disposal but then

working under your own brand monse you

know you're taking on a much bigger role

in overseeing the business side of

things so how has that experience been

on being on both sides of the coin so I

worked for Oscar for 12 years before I

started monse and during those 12 years

I knew one day I'm gonna start my own

company so I actually like watched how

they run the business very carefully and

all school was very kind enough to have

me involved in a lot of like

merchandising meeting sales meetings and

so when I was ready to start monster

I kind of knew but I also knew I needed

a good CEO so that was my first hire and

she said no but I'm like no you're

coming anyway

so she started as part-time because

she's like don't start your own company

but um I think it's important to have

someone you trust

to guide you plan financials for you but

also be interested and listen and it

can't be like I do whatever I want and

she takes care of it so we're like great

partner maybe she won't say that but I

feel like we are

but even at Oscar I still pair um pay

like attention to our profits where our

margin is and every week I get sell

through so I make sure like it's like my

report card I'm still doing well I'm

still bringing company the money they

are expecting so it kind of tell it's

like almost like reading your astrology

like okay we're doing good so it's gonna

be good next two weeks you know

I think as a creative person to not lose

control of your freedom to create at a

company you work for or the company you

own is to make sure that it's a business

that it's business is healthy you're

financially well and it does start from

design I mean you can blame sales after

or you're a CEO afterwards but the

beginning of successful fashion company

comes from the creative director so pay

attention to what's happening

financially in your work

when you start your company and I think

also appreciate people who are running

it for you because sometimes you know a

lot of designers argue with their CEOs

and stuff

so oh Gary yes I mean that that was

really a smart comment I mean totally I

agree with you and you need somebody

designers need to realize they must have

somebody next to them who can edit them

you can't self-edit I'm an author

I would write a book and my editor would

read it and give me comments and say I

fell asleep reading that chapter

and I'd look at her and ask her I'd say

is there anything you liked about it and

she said oh I absolutely loved it you

know I said well but you got to do this

you got to do this you got to do

this you can't do it yourself I couldn't

see it I can't see it I put too many

words in just as a designer might put

too much embellishment onto a product or

not enough you need an objective eye and

you need that person by your side or you

can trust and that's a vital part of

building a successful design business

I I love what you said to Laura about

um

you know looking at the sell-throughs

like your report card would you say how

much would you say that kind of data

informs your work as a designer

I think I think I'm a little different

in a way like I do love math so it is

like very exciting for me to see the

report card maybe it's like the Asian

and me I don't know I feel really good

whenever I see good numbers but I also

think it's a training I got from Oscar

because he owned his own company and um

his CEO who he's still our CEO that they

trained me to look at it learn how to

read it and see where that affects like

my budget that means like I love having

a big budget because I'm I'm a fashion

girl I love to shop and I buy a lot of

fabrics

so it is like a circle you can't avoid

the other part and still have fun on the

creative side

that's true it's it's both whether we

like it or not it's the map it's the

business and it's the creative

um Maeve I want to hear about your

business because in addition to styling

you also have your own clothing line

local love Club

um that you started so I want to hear

more about what the driving force was

for you to start that line and what that

transition was like going from that's

the story okay how long do you guys have

we have 23 minutes

um thank you yeah so the local love Club

a lot of you guys I mean you may or may

not know I love streetwear I am such a

tomboy I live in sweats and for years I

was shopping for my clients in the men's

department I didn't feel like there was

really a women's brand that was tapping

into sweats I think Alexander Wang has

gotten as close to the shape that I like

or the Fabrics that I like but there

hasn't been a huge there hasn't been a

brand that just was like oh this is my

go-to sweatband company there was things

that I felt like were missing within the

price point that I was looking to do it

and then the pandemic happened and I was

really looking obviously at like what's

next what is going to happen here it's

all of our jobs and I wanted to bring

jobs to LA and my entire you know it's

all made here in downtown L.A and in

Vernon and you know there was a moment

where I yeah like I think I didn't know

what was gonna happen and I'm such an

entrepreneur and I'm such a hustler I

was like let's do something new and it's

something I'd always wanted to do it was

just the moment to do it

um and it's been such a process and it's

I always joke this is the hardest thing

I've ever done like styling is something

I think I can do with my eyes closed at

this point there's rare moments where I

feel nervous or unprepared for something

because I've been doing it for so long

but this is you know as Gary said I mean

there's so much there's so many

components to starting a brand and I

really will say going into it I was very

naive to the fact that you know I I

thought I had this platform I have these

clients I have access to all of these

influencers and celebs this is going to

be easy you know and it hasn't been at

all

um and it's been such a learning process

and I still feel like I'm learning you

know and I still feel like

um I have so far to go with it but it is

something so important to me as a

creative you know having another

business that I'm passionate about is

just another place to sort of put my

energy into if the other thing is slow

or or whatever you know I'm I'm a plate

full kind of girl

I love that I mean it I feel like a lot

of creatives do the same thing where

they're like oh I have this one thing I

like you know what else I like I like

this project and I like this project and

you know you keep growing on that and

that's that's honestly how I feel a lot

of people are today right nobody's just

one thing I feel like everybody is a

multi-hyphenate at this point Gary you

said you're an author you know you wrote

designers and you also have other

businesses and collections everybody has

things and I think all of those things

feed into the larger part of who you are

as a creative and your business so it's

a wonderful perspective from all of you

um I am curious to talk oh yeah Gary you

have to do things you love you must love

it if you don't have it well not do this

if you don't love it because it's so

hard you know and you're also talking

about taking your life your energy away

from a social life family friends travel

whatever you know like you really to

succeed and to get to I think where any

of us are you have to be really willing

to make big sacrifices you know and and

um you have to love it

I mean if you don't make the passion

it's not going to come out in your

product it's just not going to be there

it's going to be boring and Bland you

know you have to love everything that

you do even the bad stuff and there's a

lot of bad and hard stuff in this

business you wouldn't believe it but you

have to Wade through it you have to work

through it because you have a goal in

mind and that's to create something

beautiful you know to create something

that you people everybody all the

consumers are going to want to wear and

want to feel good about you aren't we

not me necessarily but you are changing

people's lives

you're giving them a reason to feel good

in the morning you know when they get up

and they get dressed and that's so

that's such an important role

you can't take it for granted

I love that so much I really do

um something else I want to ask all of

you about is we were kind of talking

about this beforehand our our fears

right so I think it's really unifying

that even all of you at the top of your

game still we're talking about some of

your biggest fears and anxieties about

this business because it really is

tumultuous it's you know it goes with

the flow of the market it goes with the

flow of what consumers are doing so I'd

love to hear from all of you about what

some of your biggest fears are even

still today and how you tackle those

oh Laura go for it I still have

nightmares about being in college and

not finishing my homework

I wake up like sweating but um I mean

right now my biggest

fear and stress is like economy and you

know like you read about stocks you read

about Banks doing badly and because it

does affect consumers so I worry about

that a lot and I worry about whenever

like our bank account gets low at our

company for Mom's Day because for Oscar

I don't have to look at that which is so

nice

that really gives me anxieties and then

I'll be eating like plant-based food

because apparently that helps you feel a

little like less stress

so that's like I have Financial

anxieties

and also I think as a designer I'm like

am I going to run out of ideas oh that's

a really relatable one I think like once

you like I think traveling really helps

me and also like reading really helps me

and sometimes going out with my friends

who love fashion and see how they dress

that really helps me so you just have to

keep going no matter what the problem is

because the worlds keep moving on so you

have to just go with it and just figure

it out

maybe all the Clan's got some anxiety I

was just trying to think of a moment or

even just but I feel like for me like

pandemic was a really scary moment for

me I mean for everyone obviously but for

the sake of my business I didn't know

what that would look like

um you know budgets were getting cut a

lot of my designer friends peers they

were getting dropped from their

retailers because the retailers couldn't

you know cover the orders it was it was

it was a scary thing

um but it kind of It kind of turned

around for me I'm very thankful that you

know like none of my retailers did drop

you know they didn't drop my brand

um the the way that women were shopping

throughout the pandemic was it was scary

like I had this cat suit I was selling

and this cat suit was flying out like

hotcakes I was like where are these

girls going and the cat suit during the

pandemic I don't know

um and I was like thank you God you know

like this is this is great you know

because it really allowed

it it kept me inspired you know through

that scary time not knowing the

trajectory of like what I'm gonna do and

how I'm gonna keep my staff how I'm

gonna you know I have in-house sewers I

do work with manufacturers but I also

have

um you know a team of seamstresses who

develop my samples and so a lot of that

just came into like a Red Zone like I

didn't know what I was gonna do but

again just continuing to like push my

product and continuing to have the

support from retailers and you know

obviously people like Gary and hilden

like I was very very thankful for that

you know and just again just with

consumers you know being able to see the

way that

my clothes is igniting something in

people where it's like you know what

like this too shall pass when we're over

the pandemic I'm gonna wear this laquan

I'm gonna break out this laquan moment

when we get back you know like it it

show it was a level of like

um like optimism you know like I feel

like people were just sort of like

projecting of like when this is all over

we'll get back to getting sexy again so

I think that I can that for me was a

scary time and you know sort of a way

where I persevered and you know stayed

the course I really wanted your cats too

what I mean yeah and for me it's it's

exacerbated I finance about 450 Brands

so

multiply the concerns each of you have

by 450. was everyone calling you and I

have to deal with all of them yes I'm

like their father you know in many

respects it's like I have to calm them

down and say okay here's the path here's

what we're going to do during the

pandemic particularly I was writing

newsletters every Sunday I would write a

Sunday letter to all of our client base

giving them thoughts on you know

conserve your inventory don't over cut

anticipate drops in open demise from all

the retailers they're over inventoried

you know all of this stuff but as I said

multiply it 450 times so it was it was

very stressful and I don't think there's

any and I think another good thing for

entrepreneurs to understand is the when

you when you own your own business and

run your own business those concerns

never go away

don't think that you know 10 years from

now I'm going to be out on my yard in

Monte Carlo and I will never worry again

you know that's one in a hundred million

and even then they worry so there are

things you need to deal with you need to

be practical smart uh not fearful not

hide your head

face them front on and come up with a

plan

and you'll get through you'll get by

everybody does

and I just want to interject in saying

that it it's helpful to write small term

goals and long-term goals it's just it

sounds corny but it works because it

really keeps your eye on the prize can

you give us an example like how do you

do that for yourself

I mean I don't know like I don't know

where everybody's at but it can be

something as small as like

okay my six month plan is to I don't

know form an LLC or you know start my

econ business

um to

you know establishing manufacturing

right and then the long-term goal could

be like I want to be sold in this store

I want to you know I want to address

this person I want it's like you know

then you take your baby steps correct

and those baby steps seem a little more

attainable because they're a lot smaller

than that big big goal exactly I love

that

um

part of being a business owner is making

really difficult decisions so what I'd

love to talk about now is how you all

tackle those difficult decisions

um maybe laquan let's let's start with

you um I would love to hear more about

you know maybe an example if you have

one of a tough call that you had to make

in either direction and how you came to

making that decision you know who you

spoke to about it

um maybe the things you weighed

um was there like a make or break moment

where you were like oh no like what do I

do here

I'm trying to think but I think for me

like

the decisions that I make in terms of

design is it's it's

it can be really frustrating I think

because there's one specific Vision that

I have and I want to stick to it and

then when it comes down to sales you

know my sales team I'm sort of now like

trying to conform to what buyers want or

what you know Middle America wants and

that can sort of be again creatively

stifling

um so I think that there are those sort

of like

creative you know sacrifices or balances

that you know you have as a designer

where you kind of have to think a little

bit you know think think ahead of the

curve and you know if if this piece that

you're like super passionate about and

it's like you know really out there and

edgy then you got to figure out a way to

how to sell that fantasy sell that

Vision so I mean that's just you know

that's I guess you can say that's a part

of a hard process in terms of being a

creative is having a balance of you know

having you know art and and creating

Commerce as well and not compromising

because you know you you have your brand

in a you work so much to develop and

establish it's like you know you don't

want to compromise who you are you know

for the sake of sales so you know gotta

stick to your guns

uh Maeve I'd love to hear more about

decisions that you've had to make in

your business because you you have

multiple businesses and I'm sure and

when you were growing you also ran into

decisions that were complicated so how

have you dealt with some of those oh God

I pray a lot I'm just kidding um well I

do actually but um you know I was uh I

was thinking about you know I've gotten

complaints my sweats are very oversized

and they're very long and that's why I

made them truthfully I I felt like girls

sweats were always too short I hate the

ankle thing I just can't and so we get

complaints where people are like can you

make them shorter and I'm like no you

know like go find somewhere else like

I'm fine with that you know this is just

who we are and I have to stick to that

this is the brand that I wanted to

create and you know it's simple things

like that but you know I think over the

years as I've grown all of these

different businesses and these different

aspects of myself

um it's really learning of like what

makes the most sense for my time and my

energy when it comes to my styling

business you know my clients want me

physically there and so if someone

reaches out a new client or I have to

really decide you know is this someone I

can really give my all to and if I can't

you know sometimes I have to make those

calls and I want to be everywhere and I

want to do everything and I have a

really hard time saying no but I've

learned to sort of control the output

because then you find yourself you know

like retiring or like having a mental

breakdown or you know and I've tried to

find sort of like a healthy balance I

guess of my life my businesses and what

feels right for myself

um and it might not be true for the next

person but it's true for me and that's

those are questions that like you can

only answer for yourself you know like

you have to go within and say like is

this the right call is the store the

right place for me I don't want to make

that sacrifice and making those like

tough decisions I think a lot of the

time are

things that you really have to like

really go within and decide can I put my

head down on my pillow at night and be

happy with this decision you know and um

you know it's a tough business and and

there's so much that goes on and it's

really really hard to not take things

personally but I think that's been a

huge growing lesson that I've gone

through in the last few years is like

things aren't always personal they

sometimes are but they're not always and

I'm very sensitive I'm very empathic

It's Hard Out Here when you're that you

know kind of person and

um just you know doing things that are

right for me I guess has been a journey

because it's not what might not be right

for the next stylist but it was right

for me you know

and to go with that I think you know

Finding what's right for you is also a

path so we talked a little bit about

brand DNA but I kind of like to dig into

that more especially for younger

designers who are trying to figure out

well who am I what is my brand DNA I'd

love to hear from everybody about how

you went through that process especially

you know with monsee with with

everyone's line and Gary with all the

lines that you've helped to you know

usher in what are those steps that you

take to determine who you are as a brand

um so I'm gonna go first

so because I work for such a big brand

for a long time before I started my own

brand monsie I just wanted to make sure

I don't look I don't design stuff that

looks like Oscars so we had

um a lot of magazine editors buyers come

in and we were showing them sketches of

what we're going to present in the next

couple months and they would say like oh

my God it still looks like Oscar no that

still looks like Oscars so we actually

like resketched about like 20 times

before we presented our first collection

so

it was like uh almost like a therapy

session for me and my business partner

Fernando to really like get it out and

everyone around us helped us push it out

of us that created our DNA and you have

to stick to it once you have a DNA if

you don't stick to it then you would

look like everyone else on the store so

one thing is to create one another one

is to continuing your DNA with like

adjusting a little bit as the market

changes or time goes by

would you say your DNA is in your head

is it a series of visuals is it words

so we started well we didn't start that

way but at the end before we presented

our first collection it was a story

about

deconstructing your boyfriend's closet

so everything we create starts from

menswear that is adjusted to women's

wear with it being sexy because I think

it's very sexy to like stay over at your

boyfriend and then go to work in his

clothes but done in the more

um made for her way instead of just

walking out in your boyfriend's clothes

that's great I love that it's a story

Maeve what about you

um well I was thinking it's almost it's

funny as a stylist it's sometimes the

opposite you know I feel like I got

pigeonholed into being like this music

stylist this like edgy girl that just

loves everything crystals and studs and

all the things and it as I get older and

as my taste evolves or it's just like I

change I don't necessarily want to style

the same way that maybe I did five years

ago and what the business does is they

put you in this category and so these

publicists or agents or whatever like no

no she can't do sophisticated she's the

music stylist just leave her over there

you know and it's really hard to get

yourself out of it and my vision does

want to change but people can't

sometimes they don't want to give you

the the chance you know to make that

change or you know I I'm I'm older now

you know I I dress differently than the

way that I did 10 years ago when I

started and um you know it's it's just a

it's just a journey you know I um The

Styling thing is really interesting

there's so much competition there's so

many different people trying to do what

we do and it's bigger than just being

able to pick out a dress it's about

maintaining relationships with brands

with you know hair and makeup people

with agents with public it's just all

about relationships really so

you know it's all it's complicated it's

not as easy as I think people might

think it is

it evolves it is a valuable the valuable

takeaway there it's like it just because

it's you know one thing now doesn't mean

it can't evolve yeah that's great I love

that what about you no I was gonna agree

with you maybe because I I like that you

talked about the journey you know

building a DNA takes it's not just this

one-time thing and you say it and it's

like it is a journey that that does

evolve over time like I'm 34 now I'm

like

like what I was designing at 21 I'm not

designing you know I'm designing

something completely different but I

think that what I'm always thinking

about is like what people fell in love

with in the first place like what why

did people like you know like when

people fell in love with laquan Smith

what was what was that moment and so I'm

always referring back you know to like

whatever that was whether it's like

large shoulders or like cutouts or like

open back racerbacks like just

continuing that same kind of consistency

with like new you know like New Visions

like new ideas but but I think that like

what's why people like want to continue

to by laquan is because it's like they

they're relying on something that they

know that they're coming you know

they're coming to this brand for

something very specific you know I think

that's what builds brand DNA is doing it

repetitively with doing it in new ways

so if like I don't know if you're if

your signature is like puffy skirts then

give me a puffy skirt in every damn

fabric you know what I mean give me a

puff of skirt with a with crystals on

top of it give me you know it's like

it's just really about keeping it

repetitive but keeping it new keeping it

fresh keep doing it over and over and

over again I think that's how you sort

of develop brand DNA also I mean as a

designer like I love creating mood

boards you know so I'll cut out words

I'll cut out you know images references

from other designers that you know that

I'm inspired by from the past you know

and I create sort of a mood it's sort of

like it it just it speaks to like what

my vision is and what the idea is I

think that's also help with that also

helps with uh building brand DNA

thanks aquan Gary's at the ready

so I see so many Brands is this oh is

this on I see so many Brands it's

I have to find that something special in

that brand there's you know we call it

DNA we call it whatever you want I look

I've worked so long in this industry and

I and people present collections to me

every week

there's some some passion there's some

feeling there's something special I mean

when I saw you you know your first

Collections and you as you know from the

very beginning

I've I mean I I think my heart started

pounding like this is great this is

different this is new this is special

There's real talent here so you know I I

think

if you don't have that

you have to think a different course you

have to choose a different category to

produce in whether it's more commercial

whether it's you know lower price point

when you have that special

you know Magic

you just pursue your own passion and

stick with your DNA you know I always

say to people

the most successful brands have what's

called core product I don't know if

you guys know what that means but it

means product that you are identified by

and that sells over and over again

various iterations of it uh

when you can develop core product

alongside the beautiful

expansive pieces around it you're

building a business you know so there

there are many ways to identify DNA

and to utilize it

but you have to always stick to the core

and to the passion that created that

core

that's fantastic

so we're wrapping things up and I could

I could ask them pick the brains for

like another 45 minutes but we're about

to move on but before we do

um I'm gonna do like a little rapid fire

situation here and I would love it if

you could think about everybody in this

room right as you know aspiring

designers designers are starting their

collections in all different phases of

their creative lives if there is a

singular actionable piece of advice

that you could give to this room what

would it be

star to carry

yeah

be

look at yourself be introspective be

honest with yourself you either have it

or you don't

if you don't recognize that early on

don't pursue something that's never

going to happen you know they're all

aspects of this industry that you get

segue into you know but you need to know

the level of your own Talent

and sometimes it's hard to assess that

personally but talk to people get honest

answers and listen to those honest

answers

I I definitely piggyback off of that um

constructive criticism is great

um and if you ask for it don't get your

feelings hurt you know take it and and

you apply it to what however you see fit

stay the course stay committed stay I'm

a dreamer stay inspired like the world

is your oyster like I feel like everyone

there is a space for everyone you know

there is space to be successful in every

form of fashion whether it's costume

making or whether you want to be

successful in a retail space you know

custom whatever it is I think that there

is a space for everyone and

um

have fun doing it you know learn as much

as you can absorb as much information as

you can do as much research as you can

take internships do things for free you

have to it's just it just comes with the

journey

um and I think that you know the more

you learn the stronger you get the more

you do it I think it really is just a

great setup for you know the future

yeah I was gonna say do everything you

possibly can to learn and don't give up

you know I think everyone with success

everyone on the stage has had moments in

their career where they're like there is

no way I'm getting out of bed like I

cannot keep going and it's in those

moments where you persevere and you keep

you know one foot in front of the other

even if you can't see the light at the

end of the tunnel and just start walking

towards it and it'll show up

um the other thing too for me is like be

nice to everyone you meet from now until

the very end be nice sorry be

nice to everyone you meet because a lot

a lot of the people that I met 20 years

ago nearly when I started are still

around you know and I think when you

leave people feeling good when you leave

people with a smile when you bring good

energy to a room people don't forget

that you know and that is one of the

most important things to me in my life

and who I am as a business is you know

how I make people feel it's not just

about the clothes it's how you make

people feel from the inside you know you

know confidence really does come from

within so I just my goals are always to

light up a room and make people feel

better than you know when I walked into

it

um for me

um

I think

when you know you're good at something

but you're bad at something else

you should surround yourself with people

who are good at things that you're bad

at that they can support you and you can

trust them

um like I still do that every day when I

know when I can't do something at my job

I make sure I find someone or my

business partner Fernando he's very

opposite of me we have very different

opinions but like we balance each other

out and I think

that's been something that was really

special for me so I think surrounding

yourself with people who are better than

you and all the things you're not good

at

I feel like I have like one good thing

that I can do by myself really well

then you make a team and you actually

become stronger and you do much better

with your vision and your dream

that's my advice

thank you all so much this was fantastic

yes give it up for our panel

takes so much optimism creativity it

takes grit it takes you know a lot to be

a designer and to step into fashion at

this time so when you stumble on someone

who has the total package who really is

destined I think to make it in this

industry and has proven themselves you

just don't forget it it's been

almost a decade since I met laquan Smith

in that time he has exceeded every

expectation he's become one of American

Fashion's most influential designers his

clothes

I mean you've seen his clothes right

they are visually arresting exquisitely

crafted and sexy as hell

Kim Kardashian on cardi B on Haley

celebrity and they've worn one of

laquan's looks

thank you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

come on

it is my pleasure to share the stage

with

laquan Smith

[Applause]

[Music]

thank you thank you

oh

and Mike okay

all right

first of all laquan always steps in

looking like a model it's a little

unfair

now laquan thank you first of all thank

you for being here

and you and I are both from Queens

you were from Saint Albans

and I am from right around the corner in

Jamaica Queens and

we know it takes a lot to go from where

we started to

the top of fashion yeah so tell me a

little bit about the beginning of your

journey you know when you were you know

making clothes in your grandmother's

house

how did you kind of envision your future

as a designer

um hi everybody first of all

um I just want to say thank you I'm

really excited to be here

um

it's a lot to unpack

uh this journey has been it's been an

extreme roller coaster

um you know I guess

I'll start by saying that I feel as

though you know fashion sort of chose me

in a way

um I mean

ever since I can remember I've always

been you know illustrating I've always

that's my natural born talent I know how

to sketch I know how to draw and so that

was just something that I was initially

doing in the very beginning I thought oh

maybe I would be a cartoonist or maybe I

would be I don't really know I don't

think the fashion really was like in my

it wasn't in my mindset in the very very

beginning stages but it was um at the

age of 13 is when my grandmother she

bought me a sewing machine for Christmas

um and after that it was a wrap

um you know I I don't think that she

really knew that she was laying down the

foundation of you know her grandson

building a fashion Empire

um you know so at the age of 13 is when

I learned how to sew my grandmother

taught me everything I knew about

garment construction pattern making

um you know draping I mean everything

from top to bottom and so I enjoyed it I

thoroughly enjoyed it and then it was

sort of an aha moment like oh I should

be designing the clothes that I'm

sketching

um

and so even everything down to how do I

learn how to pattern make I was making

patterns out of newspapers you know

because I didn't have pattern paper I

didn't know that I had to go to the

government you know garment uh district

and get pattern paper and all the

supplies to you know to basically do

pattern making

um you know sort of like a kid when they

would like take apart a car to put it

back together again I was cutting up

some of my like my mom would you know

would give away uh close to the donation

I would cut up her her skirts I would

cut up the clothes to just really

understand like the layout and the

construction of how things were

constructed

um and so once I got the hang of it I

was just making clothes you know I was

making clothes for myself I was making

clothes for my friends I was making

clothes for my mom

um and you know I was I applied to Art

and Design high school so that's where I

really flourished

um did anybody attend Art and Design any

Art and Design high school

yay all right

um so I that's sort of where I really

flourished because growing up in Jamaica

Queens growing up in St Albans I was

definitely weird I was a weirdo I was

considered a weirdo like I was

considered a I was considered all

types of crazy things and I really just

felt you know like designing and

creating was sort of my like that was my

Saving Grace that was something that

like it made me feel safe it made me

feel protected and it was something that

I had really focused on so by the time I

reached High School like I was with

like-minded creatives you know I was

going to school and I would see like

boys and girls with like blue hair and

piercings and I was like yes this is

where I need to be you know like I just

felt like I felt at home

um and even it's it's interesting today

because even some of my peers that I

went to Art and Design I mean everyone

is just blossoming you know in their own

in their own uh you know in their own

right so I mean that's sort of the early

on phase of sort of growing up in Saint

Albans

um you know my mom definitely had a huge

influence on my taste you know my mom

had me at a very young age and so the

foundation of how I was raised you know

I had my grandma I have my grandpa and I

have my mom you know and so

you know the journeys of going to church

the journeys of you know we would get on

the subway and she would take me to

Manhattan I mean these are the things

that was sort of like

just influencing me you know New York is

like that's my birth like that's where

I'm from that's sort of the start of my

inspiration nightlife you know it's just

that when I used to hit 42nd Street like

lights camera action like it just gave

me a rush I knew that I wanted to be a

part of something really great and I

wanted to contribute to you know making

women look beautiful because I'm just

fascinated by women I love people

watching and it's just sort of that's

just how I got started absolutely now

tell me a little bit about I mean you

know building up your references

building up your you know aesthetic and

your perspective I mean I have to travel

right what were some of your earliest

influences

um early influences I mean I love music

I love Pop Culture I love movies you

know Boomerang I love Grace Jones I grew

up listening to Little Kim like I love

Destiny's Child like all those things

JLo like these are the things that was

sort of I was surrounded by that

I found glamorous I found Fab you know

and I wanted to I was like wow this is

really really cool so I mean I think

everything from music choices to

um I think everything from you know

music choices to movies to traveling

um it really it shaped my taste in

fashion it really gave me I'm sorry

it really gave me a perspective on like

you know what my DNA is or what it was

um you know I've always been into like a

sense of retro Elegance you know like I

love modernity I love anything that's

modern and sexy and cool so you know for

me it's like growing up in New York was

like

it was sort of shaping me into like

what it is that you know like who I was

gonna become as a designer absolutely

now obviously the road towards you know

your career has not been just a cakewalk

hasn't been easy you experienced some

early rejections like you know not

getting into fit in persons which are

you know to have the usual sort of

Pathways towards a career in design tell

me a little bit about how you handled

that and how you grew from that those

experiences

so um After High School uh I did apply

to fit and Parsons

um and but I was rejected that's the gag

I was rejected and I didn't I wasn't

really smart about it I didn't apply to

like backup schools I didn't you know

there wasn't a plan B like I I just knew

exactly what I wanted to do

um and exactly where I wanted to study

and because that didn't work out for me

that was a very

um low moment in my life it was very

devastating I mean I spent about two

years just trying to quote unquote

figure it out and at the same time like

I had all this talent I was making all

these clothes making these you know

making things for myself and you know I

had the pressure like the real pressure

from my family you know like while all

my friends was like you know going away

to college and everybody was having you

know going away parties like I'm sitting

here like

toodling my thumbs like well what am I

gonna do

um and my mom

was very much like you know like any mom

would be okay lay well why don't you go

and you know take a couple courses take

some business courses at Community

College or do this and I was like no

girl like I want to be you know like I

want to be draping like I want to do

this I I just had a vision

um so while all trying to figure it out

I mean of course I worked retail jobs

and of course I had a side hustle I was

making dresses for you know women all

around New York

um

it was just like what's the trajectory

what are you doing my family was like

what are you doing you know they they

certainly supported me you know they put

me in art school they did all the things

but it was really now like what's the

future looking like for you um and that

was something that was just really

unclear for me as far as like how do I

break into the business what do I do

um

so it's just important for you guys to

understand that this moment of failure

kind of motivated me to then do it my

own way figure it out my own way

um so at that point

I I sort of use the method of like how

you know old school rappers would like

sell CDs from their trunk you know I was

basically I mean I didn't have models I

didn't have a muse so I was wearing my

own stuff like I was wearing catsuits I

was wearing like you know and it wasn't

like oh this man is dressing up as a

girl it was more like because my

references were like Grace Jones and

like David Bowie and like Lenny Kravitz

like I was pushing the boundaries you

know like I was certainly pushing the

boundaries in a way where it was Fab you

know it was very Fab and so I would like

walk into these parties and I'd sneak

into these parties parties that I was

certainly not on the list for and I

would pretend like I was somebody excuse

me do you know who I am you know and

people were just gags because I just

looked so awesome and the reaction from

women would be like oh my God can I

touch can I where did you get this from

I designed it so what I was doing was I

was like twirling around New York going

to these parties making these um my

first product you can say was these sort

of like 3D leggings and there was this

gold metallic 3D leggings that I made

they took all of like maybe 25 minutes

to make and I was cranking them out like

every day I made about maybe five pair

maybe four to five pair every night

um and I would have them on but the

thing was that like I couldn't because

my grandparents are like very religious

um I had to like put these clothes in my

backpack and you know say I'm going to

work but then I would like go to

Starbucks and change into this full-on

catsuits and people would be like wait

what you know and and it was it was bold

it was daring but I kind of had a I had

a method to my madness so when people

when I would see like Fab women and like

the meme hacking District or like in the

clubs like I'd be like oh my God you're

still Fab I'm so inspired by you like

here and then people be like what are

you giving me and I'm like girl I'm

giving you the look get into it you know

and sometimes people would be like no

I'm not interested or sometimes people

like is this guy unreal like whoa and so

I was doing that for like

a long time a long time and that's sort

of the beauty of like New York it's a

Melting Pot so now these leggings are

like everywhere they're everywhere

um because not only am I giving them out

for free but I'm giving them out for

free I'm also like you know people are

people are now discovering this I'm

charging them you know my little side

hustle and then long before you know it

I'm in the supermarket with my meanwhile

I don't have a real business I don't

have anything yet I'm still like working

retail jobs and I'm interning at black

book magazine and all this stuff and um

I was in the Super Market with my mom

and I opened up one of the tabloids and

it was Lady Gaga in my leggings

yeah

and I was like wait this is this is and

I like race though I was like Mom look

at this and she's like that's nice what

did you apply to so and so did you go to

did you do this test did you apply to

that school

and I I don't know for me it was like

things which are sort of unfolding in a

way where like it gave me affirmation it

gave me confirmation that like I'm on

the road to something greater but I

wasn't really getting the monetary value

you know I didn't really know how to put

put it together like in a business

format yeah

um and that's sort of what I can speak

to in terms of like my my first early

product and so even and beyond that you

know like personalities like Andre J was

showing up in Paris you know to very

exclusive uh you know Bergdorf Goodman

parties I mean Linda Fargo and Jason Wu

and all these designers that you know I

wanted to be like Alexander Wang all

these cool kids

uh Andre J is wearing laquan Smith in

Paris I don't know something about

reading that in fine black and white

print gave me motivation like this is

this is this is great absolutely

um then next thing you know Rihanna's

wearing my cat suit and the rude boy

video and you know so it's just these

are all achievements that I'm making on

my own accord you know no backing no PR

no business plan

until finally someone said to me um you

know you want to do if if you're going

to do this right you got to put out a

collection yeah right because like just

doing these little one-off custom pieces

here and there it's like what

if you want to do this the right way you

got to put out a line put out a

collection let's sell the collection

so then that following year was sort of

my my moment where I sort of stopped

partying I sort of stopped doing what I

was doing and really focused on building

a collection and building a collection

it takes a lot of money to do which I

didn't have so just really the support

the support that I had from you know my

friends the community in New York my

family my friends

um you know I put together a very small

presentation in 2010 and that is the

that's the year that really completely

changed my life um just to give you guys

a timeline I was 21 at the time and

um because I had all this like press

happening I was like who's this kid

there's leggings this that

um New York Times there's a journalist

Ruth lafurla she did a piece on me she

came to my house

and my grandmother was kind of clutching

her pearls like who are all these people

in my house you know photographers and

cameras because they were just

uncovering like they couldn't believe

that this young guy is making clothes in

his grandmother's house and it's all on

celebrities I just think people were

just kind of like perplexed by that

whole storyline

um and so that was my Atelier that was

my studio that was my showroom like my

my room like in my grandmother's

basement you know that's kind of like

that's how I got started and uh

the New York Times article came out and

it was entitled The Fashion Week version

that's what it was called

um and I showed up the Society of

illustrators on the Upper East Side and

someone tapped me on my shoulder we're

about to you know Showtime's about to

start and I mean models like like my

friends you know like I didn't have a

budget you know I didn't have a budget

to pay for models so these were just

like my friends and everyone's just

pitching in because I had a level of

support people were like I believe in

this kid and so someone Taps me on the

shoulder and says to me uh Mr Smith um

Andre leontelli has just entered the

building uh the late Andre uh tally was

a huge mentor to me a great friend of

mine and he truly changed my life like

he I mean he really

I give him the credit for you know sort

of exposing me to Fashion you know and

really introducing me and opening the

doors for you know

building an empire absolutely no you're

someone who you hustled you put in the

work to go out and make those

connections to go out and really promote

yourself

what do you think are some lessons that

you learned during that time that young

designers can really use in order to get

their name out there in order to get you

know the attention of people who can

really make those things happen for them

[Music]

um I mean my my response to that is you

know I I definitely was bold I was

Fearless like I didn't have anything to

lose I wasn't embarrassed about walking

up to people walking up to Linda Fargo

walking up to Fern malice who at the

time was you know

um you know the headliner of you know

New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park

like I wasn't afraid I just kind of was

like the worst thing that anybody can

say is no then keep it moving you know

because somebody else will give you an

opportunity

um this is also the time where like

Instagram wasn't a thing you know so

like I think for me like networking was

so imperative you know getting my face

out there you know getting business

cards getting my work out there shaking

hands getting the product out there

getting people to understand you know it

was it was I was very heavy in

networking

um and so I mean I still find that to be

very very essential you know I mean and

how you do it in today's world when

everything is just so like online it's a

little bit harder I think but um you

know I think when I don't know in the

Myspace era like that was my portfolio

like that was my Instagram like you know

I was putting clothes up on you know on

my MySpace on my Facebook I mean so

everything that I was doing was just

sort of a portfolio of my work

um so I think that like continuing to

sort of have that mindset getting your

products out there you know getting your

clothes out there be you know

you know the world is your oyster you

know and I think that people are as long

as you're asking questions and want to

learn you know I think that it's

definitely a setup for you know great

success amazing now one of the things I

really find incredible about your

designs is that they attract powerful

women they attract people who have a

sense of self and really

um you know a true sense of style

what would you say are some of your

favorite moments of you know celebrities

or even just you know friends wearing

your pieces yeah I've had a lot y'all

like I've had a lot of moments just when

I think it couldn't get any better it

got better it got hotter

um

I mean I mean

every designer wants to dress Beyonce

let's just be clear you know like that's

just a major accomplishment in itself

you know dressing Beyonce dressing Kim

Kardashian and Gaga and Serena Williams

I mean it was these are all incredible

achievements and I think that it says a

lot as far as like

who my woman is you know like I'm

dressing so many different women

different body types but the trajectory

is still very sexy

um you know and that's something that

I'm all about I'm not somebody who is

designing for you know like my

collection is not for the faint of heart

you know like it's it's for women who

want to be the center of attention it's

for the women who you know they they

want to bring their sexy back you know

to where laquan Smith is an experience

it's like the same way that you know I

talked about when I wore my designs and

the reaction that I would get those are

the same reactions that women get it's

storytelling you know and it's

conversational

um and I think that that's one of the

things that

I think just sort of held me through

throughout my entire career because it

was really hard to get support from the

fashion inside you know I like it was

hard to get support from editors or to

get support from buyers you know like so

I kind of was just in a weird way like

leaning in on celebrities I was allowing

celebrities to sort of dictate my future

if that makes any sense you know they

were they weren't introducing me as like

women's wear designer it was like

celebrity designer designer to the stars

and it it sort of pigeonholed me at one

point because

then women would come up to me and say

do I have to be a celebrity to wear

laquan it's like no girl you know like

I'm building something that for every

woman and every woman can you know have

a piece of laquan so it took time to

sort of like Rebrand and redirect you

know um what that looks like and and it

took a lot of time and it took a lot of

growth as far as you know me being a

designer

um Building Product categories I'm just

getting a better I mean for me I think

it's also like

I was growing as a designer and so I was

growing even as a business you know and

just to interject on that part like I

know I'm kind of bouncing all over the

place but every creative every designer

needs a business partner I don't care

how you flip the script like I've

started doing it all on my own I sold

the clothes myself I you know I was

delivering the clothes myself I made the

clothes myself until I met my amazing

business partner best friend Jackie who

at the time

um we were out one day I remember and

Jackie uh she's like I'm from Queens I

was like well I'm from Queens too and I

was out where my full-on get up and she

goes well where are you going I'm going

home and she goes how are you getting

home I'm getting on the train take the E

train stay straight to Jamaica she go

you're not getting on the train looking

like that

and uh she gave me a ride home and we

have been you know we've been the best

of friends ever since and so I remember

there was even a period in time where

Jackie said to me laquan I want to help

you you know um and so I think Jackie

really just

allowed me to sort of

breathe a little bit it allowed me to be

a designer you know sometimes being a

designer and to deal with the business

stuff it can be creatively stifling

because you're trying to juggle

everything

um and so you know really having you

know having a partner it just you need a

balance there has to be a balance now

you're someone who always had a really

strong point of view but how do you feel

that your work has evolved over time

like what is the Quan Smith Now versus

laquan Smith when you were 21.

well as I said before like I think that

for me like designing these like

one-of-a-kind pieces having a business

where it was only custom based

um now women are coming to me for

full-on outfits they're going away on

vacation and they want not just a hot

sexy dress but they want a bodysuit they

want an outerwear piece they want a

cardigan you know it really I think I

have evolved as a designer by building

my product categories

um even if you know let's say outerwear

is like five percent of my business I

don't care I'm still I love a good

outerwear I love a good showing I love a

good fur jacket you know it's really

about

um Building Product categories

um so that it does sort of lend itself

to be sort of a Lifestyle brand you know

I think that's sort of the way that I've

expanded because now it's it's exciting

to see the way that women are shopping

laquan Smith now your collections during

Fashion Week I feel like each season you

really sort of raise the bar for

yourself tell me a little bit about your

most recent collection of you know how

it reflects this current you know stage

of your career

well I just recently

um debuted my full winter 23 collection

at the Rainbow Room in New York on

Rockefeller Center uh rainbow room is

just very iconic place where all the

upper echelon the elites of New York

would go back in the 30s 1920s or

something like that

um it's just a very nostalgic Jazzy sexy

place it's a staple you know and I think

that everything that I do everything

that my brand represents is a sense of

luxury and sensuality

um and it was it was an experience

that's what it's like to come to a

laquan Smith runway show or laquan Smith

after party like people are leaving like

whoa that was amazing uh we had you know

champagne and caviar and you know of

course I was watching episodes of

Dynasty and I was just like these women

are just so damn Fab like why is Alexis

Carrington just waking up you know in

the full-on chiffon silk you know

drinking champagne like it just really

was it inspired me I mean inspired it

inspired my you know my entire Vision my

entire layout for the collection I

almost wish that we could show a video

of it

um and so yeah that was sort of the

collection I mean I really wanted to

just replicate you know sort of a

nostalgic retro Glam I I want to return

you know I I sort of want fashion to

sort of come back in a way it seems as

though I'm feeling in a white space like

I want to get back to dressing up again

you know streetwear has had their moment

and now it's time to like turn it you

know like and so that's what it's about

now when it comes to I mean you

mentioned you know outerwear even if

it's a small percentage of your business

it's something that you want to include

because it expands you know the

portfolio tell me a little bit about a

category maybe you haven't done or

something that you would love to do next

in terms of your design

oh I would love to do lingerie I would

love to do lingeries Believe It or Not

lingerie is just so delicate it's one of

the most hardest things to construct in

terms of manufacturing because

everything is just so pristine and

delicate but it takes a lot of time

um I don't know maybe a collaboration

with Asian provocateur or something I

just I just think that luxury would just

I'm sorry excuse me lingerie would just

be like it would make the most sense for

me that's definitely one product

category that I would love to venture

off into and then also I mean of course

I love a good shoe like I love boots you

know like I want to definitely expand on

you know shoe shoes and out excuse me

eyewear and fragrances and you know and

Beauty I mean that is really that's

that's sort of the next phase that's the

next step but I think it's important as

designers

um and creatives to sort of like not

take on too too much at once you know

like I'm a firm believer that like slow

and steady wins the race like grow

graciously like understand like the ins

and outs of what works and what doesn't

and I think that you know eventually

throughout time you know you give people

a little bit at once you can't give them

too much

now when it comes to you know dressing

people obviously we went through the

extensive list of people that you've

already dressed is there anyone you

haven't dressed yet

who would you would love to see in

laquan Smith who you feel would be a

moment

well um I mean I I think I've dressed a

lot of rock stars but I think now it's

been exciting to sort of like

um you know be considered for Vanity

Fair and Oscars and you know actresses

Hollywood actors like I think that

that's sort of like the next phase you

know like I think that like

people know me for sexy yes it's

cocktail I definitely have been doing

really great with you know giving day

wear offerings but really pushing the

envelope with evening like what does

laquan Smith evening look like

um that's something that I'm really sort

of excited about you know pushing the

envelope on I think it's sort of like

that's that's what I grew up when I grew

up watching VMAs and Oscars and this and

that and everyone's in a Versace moment

and then Dolce Gabbana like that's what

it's about you know like I just and I

think that it sets the president and it

sets sort of like the fantasy of like

wow I want to be that girl so then you

come in and you go to Saks and you buy

your laquan Smith moment and you have

that experience

now

tell me a little bit about you know what

do you want your customer to feel when

they're wearing the Quan Smith like when

they're having that laquan Smith moment

what do you want them to feel what do

you want them to sort of

you know be embracing about themselves

when they're wearing your clothes

definitely is confidence you know I

think confidence is definitely number

one um the takeaway is sex appeal you

know it's it's it's femininity it's

sensuality it's it's a feeling of uh

luxury

um you know just feeling great you know

I don't I I think that excuse me I think

that it obviously starts from within you

know and then clothes just is just that

extra layer it's just the icing on the

cake

um I think we all love luxury you know

and so I think that whether if it's a

luxury handbag or a luxury cream that

you put on your faces there's a takeaway

um and I and I like that women have this

feeling of feel empowerment when they

wear my clothes they feel empowered and

they feel confident if they feel strong

they feel sexy I mean there's all these

different versions of what women

experience when wearing laquan you know

she walks into a room and she is the

center of attention you know her outfit

is a conversation starter some man is

trying to pick her up you know the girl

the girls are like girl where did you

get that piece you know it's that's

that's the feeling I mean I think that's

the takeaway you know she is that girl

she's definitely that girl now when

earlier I mean you mentioned a little

bit about you know

having difficulty breaking through into

that sort of fashion mainstream

when did you feel like okay I've made it

I'm here this is my moment

I

I think I I felt that way when I when I

was picked up at my first first

department store which was Saks Fifth

Avenue which was not that long ago

believe it or not

um

you know I once took a class at Macy's

it's called retail math class it was

called um brag Workshop retail math

because that's also essential to know as

a designer like

like where you're gonna sit in a store

you know like what floor do are you

considered contemporary are you

considered luxury at what price point

you know do you do you price out your

clothing I mean this is all like Vital

Information that you should know

um I I was definitely not interested in

being sold at Macy's but I just wanted

to learn like what that looks like if if

I'm even interested in being in a

department store because that comes with

another host of just

um pressure to deliver and manufacture

and you know keep keeping you know

quality control and delivery and all

this stuff

um but when I got picked up in Saks

Fifth Avenue I was screaming I was

shouting at the top of my lungs I

dragged my mom to Manhattan I was you

know displayed in the window I mean my

team we were just all thoroughly excited

I mean I think that was sort of the

moment that made me feel like

you know wow this is really happening

because I think just

just to even understand like the

struggles that I went through like yes

I'm dressing all these celebrities yes

I'm in all these magazines but not

because they they're writing up about

like what's laquan's Vision they're only

writing me up they're only writing about

laquan Smith is because I'm being

credited for what these Superstars are

wearing you know there's a difference it

wasn't like people are saying let's do a

five-page spread on the Quan and just

tap into his ore let's get into laquan's

world it was like you know I was getting

write-ups because I was dressing Kim

Kardashian you know and so and that's

fine too I was still using those things

that to my advantage but there was a

disconnect it's like how am I dressing

celebrities how am I in magazines how am

I everywhere but I'm not in sold in any

stores and then when I would go to Vogue

and I would do desk sides with editors

the first question they would ask me

what stores are you sold in I was like

it's like crickets I couldn't tell you

you know I I had a few you know very

very small

um boutiques around the city you know

around the world but it wasn't

significant enough you know it wasn't

you know The Prestige of being in these

institutions like Saks Avenue and

Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom's I mean

that is sort of like

it's just it's just another layer of

success and it's just like it's an

Accolade that I think opens up another

portal for you know for you as a

designer for people to take you

seriously absolutely I mean you're

bringing up a lot of great points about

things that I think Young designers

really need to know before sort of like

you know putting their collections

forward are there things that you know

other other things that we haven't sort

of touched on that you feel young

designers

should study or look into or

address before they you know start on

the Journey of really sort of promoting

their collections yeah I mean I think

just kind of it's not everyone's dream

to be in a department store you know

some people are okay with just having a

custom business some people might just

want to stick to Bridal some people

might just want to only design for

celebrities I mean I think it's really

important to understand like where you

want to be placed in fashion you know

like do you want to be on a more

contemporary like you know

275 300 dress point or you know do you

want to be in more of a luxury you know

1500 you know like you just gotta

understand like where you want to be

placed in the market and then once you

understand where you want to be placed

on the market then you figure out who

your competitors are you figure out

where if I'm going to be sold in a store

where will my close what design is what

my clothes sit next to

um figure out the brand DNA figure out

what the ethos of of you know your your

brand means what does it represent what

does it mean if a woman wears your item

or your your piece you know what is that

take away where does she live what does

she smell like how old is she does she

have kids what kind of car she's driving

where is she traveling to these are all

the things that

I think helps a designer really put into

perspective like who their target

audience is what they're designing for

um who they're designing for I mean

these are all very very like important

facts to know about you know who you

know your customer base if that makes

any sense absolutely now I feel one

thing that I really love about you I

feel like you absolutely know who your

audience is is there anyone or is there

anything that you've learned by

listening to your audience any sort of

feedback you've received or you know

direction that you've taken from the

people who are you know buying your

clothes or following you on social or

really sort of paying attention to what

you're doing yeah I think for me

sometimes I get a little bit like

I get a little bit sad when women say

like

oh like I'll be like oh like you know

when I used to have the body or you know

when I lose weight I'll wear laquan or

you know I don't know I want laquan to

be for everybody

and so those are sort of the takeaways

that I sort of learned is that like the

reality is that like no one is perfect

we all are working on our physical form

um and there are certainly

key elements

um in my design Aesthetics that allows

something for everybody right so like a

woman never loses weight on her shoulder

so then maybe it's about an off the

shoulder moment you know what I mean

like I mean some people love showing off

their legs some people love showing off

their decolletage some people love

showing their backs some people love you

know it's so many different areas of the

body that it really is about what where

does she feel the most confident you

know and so that really that really does

allow me to expand creatively

um and think about

different ways think about the body

think about different cuts different

Silhouettes that could make any woman

whether she's you know 25 or 50 feel the

same exact way feel just as confident

just as sexy just as whatever you know

like that's that's sort of like

my takeaway when I listen to women talk

about

um what they aspire to look like or what

they wish that you know like I always

just think about I think about my mom

you know and where she's at in her stage

in life and I think about my girlfriends

I mean it really it's for me it's like I

love people watching I love listening to

women I love watching the way that women

just get dressed and you know the the

offering some women are more into

Blazers you know and you know more

conservative I mean and I love a good

Blazer I mean I did about like like 15

blazes this collection I was like in the

studio like why do we have so many damn

Blazers you know because I was just like

Blazer obsessed like Blazers lapel sat

and this that but then like it got

really exciting and fun to build the

collection it got exciting to do the

style out you know like put a Blazer on

top of the bralette with the evening

skirt put a Blazer on top of the catsuit

it just made everything like evolve and

sophisticated but still sexy and that's

sort of the evolution of how you like

you know you grow it's just offering new

products and pushing it you know now

what's your favorite part of the design

process now is it still sketching or is

it that style up period is it you know

working on the fabrication like what is

the part that really gets you excited

right now I think for me like I used to

just sketch and then I would like and

then I would like try to find the

Fabrics to match the sketch but nah now

I just go to Paris I go to Premiere

Vision there's a trade show which I

encourage all of you guys to go check

out anybody who's really into fabrics

and textile like everything from leather

fur you know pony hair like denim I mean

Premiere vision is like it's it's your

world you know everything garments top

bottom like you know custom button

zippers like it's just it's a three-day

um it's it's a three-day trade show and

it and and even still when you

experience it you leave like I still

haven't seen it all it's immersion yeah

and so for me like I get excited when I

you know meet new um New Mills from

Italy or Japan you know I'm really into

the textile world I love fabric I love

Fabrications and I think that it really

tells a story within itself so I start

with the fabric is when I then start

developing my sketching and I start

really going to that process

um and then it can be really frustrating

too because then you know the vision

sort of like it sort of changes it goes

from sketch to you know to now like

first samples and it might not come out

the best you know all of it's all about

fabric manipulation and how things are

sort of blossoming in in the way that

you see fit and it's exciting in the

same in the same sense because it's like

something a comp like a complete

disaster will happen but it's like oh

this is actually kind of bomb you know

and and it turns you into another

Direction and then of course like

working with like legendary stylists

this past season I work with Patty

Wilson like legendary

um I've watched Patty since a very very

early age I would watch look at all of

her editorials in W magazine and all her

work with Stephen Klein like I would put

up these like editorials on my wall and

say like one day like I want to work

with these people

um so it's just like a pinch me moment

that now everything is sort of coming

into fruition but even you know styling

the collection and like I'm not a

stylist right like I just love I know

how to make a good luxury garment like I

know I make a good quality piece but to

put it together is like that's just not

my Lane that's sort of where like it's

like where the collaboration starts to

come in you know having someone who can

help me build that vision and tell the

storyline now one of the things that I

think that um you really value is of

course collaboration now how would you

say

what advice would you give to Young

designers about

building that creative team around

themselves surrounding themselves with

the people who are really going to help

Elevate the work that they're doing yeah

you definitely need to surround yourself

with people that believe in you um

that's number one

um surround yourself with people that

are excited about what you're doing

um

surround yourself with people that are

smarter than you uh you know it's it's

all for the better

um you know I think that like just

having a it even it was hard for me to

like build my team you know like I would

because I was so used to doing

everything myself it was so hard to let

go of a lot of responsibility you got to

know how to trust everything is a trial

a trial you know trial and error period

so if it doesn't work out that's fine

move on but there's all there's always

people out there that are just more than

willing to just help and you know when

it comes down to collaborations I mean

not I'm very particular with

collaborations

um it's important that you know we we

share the same values as a brand um it's

important that you know we the

trajectory of sort of like the

storytelling of what we're promoting we

just have to be aligned now you

mentioned that when people first started

writing about you they were really

focused on the celebrities they were

focused on you know so and so where's

what but now I think the tables have

turned I think people are very

interested in you now what has it been

like to sort of step into that role I

feel like it's very different than the

day-to-day of being a designer but to

have people also interested in you as a

person

yeah that's that's a great question

Janelle because I I'm always believe it

or not guy I'm really shy like my palms

are sweaty like I was actually nervous

coming up here like I'm so used to just

like letting the work speak for itself

and I sat with that for a long time but

the reality is is that like I am cool

and I and I do have a great personality

and people do want to get to know me so

that is that's it's been you know it's

been a great journey just building

relationships with so many different

people I mean I also think that that's a

part of like

you know evolving you know as a design

as a brand too like yes the work is

great but like having that one-on-one

like that face to face taking someone

out for dinner asking for you know piece

of advice getting consultation from

somebody I mean it goes a long way I

think relationships and friendships are

really really valuable thing in this

industry you know and the way that I

like to think about it is like before

even asking for money or asking for an

opportunity I think the Friendship is

really like the best takeaway you know

what I mean because that's just gonna

naturally you know they're gonna be like

oh I was thinking about you you know for

this project you know it's naturally

going to happen I think I think it's

really about building friendships and

building relationships first

now you mentioned that being with your

last collection you're obsessed with

blazers what are you obsessed with right

now

I don't want to give it away because I'm

working on the collection right now

um

I've just been obsessed with futurism

right now I've like but 1960s futurism

like Pierre Cardin and Barbarella like

just just out of Spacey kind of cool

stuff um that's kind of where my head's

at right now but I mean like how do you

bring that into like reality where

that's what we're still trying to figure

out

um but I mean I I love watching like

just getting lost just getting lost in

the sauce on YouTube going down all

these weird old videos and just I mean

anything can spark your memory even like

sometimes I like my best friend he like

loves Little Kim and Biggie and

sometimes like these he'll send me like

references on Instagram it's like some

of these music videos go off you know

what I mean like the production like

Hype Williams and like light like

lighting and production I mean all these

things are just so inspiring to me you

know it can I mean I think that

inspiration you kind of you gotta just

catch it that's sort of also too like

the frustrating part in being and being

a designer like like you have the design

on a schedule like now it's like you

have six months to produce a collection

and it's sort of like the pressure is is

saying you know it's time consuming and

you're constantly trying to like fetch

for like what's the new idea what's that

new moment what's the new vision but

it's it's gonna it's gonna hit you

sooner than later

now where would you suggest you know

young designers go when they need

inspiration when I mean

as you mentioned the schedule for

designers is crazy you constantly have

to like recharge and find yourself and

really sort of like explore and dig deep

what advice would you give to Young

designers who are you know putting

together their own collections when they

need to get inspiration where should

they go

um I mean you can go to you know take a

trip trip is always nice go to go to the

museums you know the Met is always

beautiful you know if you're not a

member at the Met be sign up it's always

just nice just to go you know and just

really like dive deep

um into the like the history of things

obviously the New York Public Library

you know is just the library's great I

mean I think that like it it just expose

yourself to as much as you can you know

um like I said take a trip watch some

movies get into it like go back and you

know go back in time

um you know pull up old references you

know uh that that's sort of how I do

things

we're almost at time but I would love to

know you know when obviously your pieces

have they made it too met related to the

museum what do you want people to look

back and remember about laquan Smith's

work

I don't know I think that I I mean when

I'm someday gone I want I want laquan

Smith to sort of have this the essence

of of desirability and femininity you

know the way that like every woman like

loves a Coco Chanel handbag you know

it's like the Timeless piece you know

like I always want to have this and then

also like being a black man like making

a staple putting my putting my Mark

um in American from American luxury

perspective as a black man I mean that's

so important to me because as I grew up

like I didn't have I didn't see that I

didn't witness that so I think that also

too like just my journey and like the

things that I've done it's just it

really just opens up another a bigger

portal for like other designers of color

to be able to be in that space too

absolutely I think that is one of the

real triumphs of this moment you know

opening the door for that next

Generation so that their journey is

going to be

a little smoother well laquan thank you

thank you guys so much thank you

[Applause]

thank you

hi hi girl thank you so much for

choosing me to be your partner fashion

should just be fun and colorful

this feels very weird being so far from

each other I'm so excited to be working

together I don't speak English that's

okay we will just use chat

we've called our collection

Eterna

Eterna means Timeless in Spanish I'm

surrounded by Nature here in Arizona we

have beautiful mountains we have a

beautiful sky view those things really

made this become the sky is the limit

collection

just finished my first meeting with

Deborah I already have an idea of what I

want the collection to look like the

name of our collection is extent and

it's a play on the theme of x

I feel like we should definitely work

with your flowers and create something

just really bold yes it's a good idea

our collection is called chasmo this one

here is almost ready and we wanted to do

it on this kimono one yes on the back

our name for this collection is

enlightened

I love all the different colors like the

Reds and the pinks and the orange they

look really really good

our collection is part animal part

Resort where so the wild ethno which is

the perfect title for the collection

the hardest part of the design process

is narrowing down some of our crazy

ideas to make sure that they're

understandable to everyone our

collaboration is named till C Street I

got some things done hopefully you like

what I have amazing

the name of our project is Sparks of

transformation and what it pretty much

represents is people coming out and

being free being free and who they are

and living in your truth it's been a lot

of different back and forth I did some

sketches as well I came up with three

girls but I wanted to make them kind of

look like aliens like with some elf ears

our collection is called GXP it's a

fantasy Motocross brand I don't think

there's any time to sleep like we

literally have two days

deadlines it's always a little bit

nerve-wracking you want this to be a

perfect collection we're almost there

but we still have work to do

the name of our collaboration is Hotel X

I love what you did with the print

placement I think it's stunning together

I can't wait to see what this looks like

in real life

girl I just think that we Both Deserve

like a good old Pat on a bag

okay they finally arrived I am so pumped

are you excited you ready

you look so cute I love the way the

colors came out I love the jacket I

think it turned out perfect oh

oh wow that's so beautiful I really

really love it

so cute

oh my God it looks so good on you

my favorite piece for sure is the suit I

love it so much yeah

it feels a bit surreal grateful for the

opportunity to be able to create

something and have it out there in the

world looking at these garments I am

absolutely Amazed by what we have both

created

I'm just really excited to see how other

people are going to wear them and style

them

you can see the artist you can see the

inspiration behind the prints we wanted

to make sure that that really came

through I think we together could

transform an idea that is very abstract

to something beautiful I think that's

amazing I really liked it this

collaboration is a huge and valuable

experience for me it means a lot when

you have an artist and a designer coming

together to create magical piece that

comes together and says that is Art we

definitely thank you she in for merging

the gap

is yours

Shein,"#SHEINxSTHE - Discover our new collection that's infused with Brazilian flair",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5OoNRjAeVc,"[Music]

what inspired me to select the pieces from

this collection was our tropical climate

and the Brazilian woman for me I found

this synonymous with quality, comfort and

cost-effectiveness

[Music]

when buying the characteristics that

a piece has to have for me

mainly the variety of sizes

because I'm very thin so I use

XP if I had to choose between

comfort and style Actually, they are two

essential qualities, you know, but I think

I prefer to be stylish I like

Close

for me fashion basically freedom and

when  I dress and feel good this

is completely connected with my

self-esteem a curiosity about me

a lot of people don't know is that I always

had the dream of being Globeleza now

not so much but when I was a kid

I watched it I thought it was the coolest thing  beautiful

in the world I used to stand in front of the TV dancing the

samba imagining that one day I

could be me, who knows,

since my accident at the end of

last year, the relationship with my body and the

way I dress changed because I

started to see  life and many

things in a different way

In the past I would buy clothes and

wear them for a special occasion and today

for me all special occasions if

I could send a message to

my followers it would be that believe

in you don't give up on your dreams

because if  God he put the dream in

your heart surely you are able to

fulfill

Sephora,Summer 2023 Everyday Skin Prep + Makeup Look | Sephora,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D71ltAkEzng,it just looks airbrushed that's what it  is that's the word airbrushed  [Music]  hey guys it's Janice and I'm here with  Sephora today I'm going to be showing  you guys my everyday summer makeup look  for me before applying any type of  makeup I love to start with skincare I  always like to go in with a vitamin C  because it gives me a really nice glow  underneath all my makeup so this is the  pharmacy of vitamin C serum  I love the texture I love the way that  it makes my skin glow from within it  looks so good perfect for those summer  days when you really want your skin to  shine through I'm sure you guys can see  looks bomb so we did the serum we have  to apply a moisturizer a go to fave the  Fenty skin this is the hydroviser  protects your skin but also moisturizes  has an SPF of 30. again it gives you  that really nice glow and it smells so  good love the texture of this also it's  super lightweight gives me that Flawless  base so girls it's time for the makeup  most of you guys know I'm not really a  huge makeup girly so we're gonna do a  little natural B that's the way I like  it especially during the summer months  less is more so we're gonna start with  concealer this is the Too Faced  concealer and I use the shade Chestnut  so I like to just apply underneath the  eyes don't have to use a lot and then  just right here for like a little bit of  color correcting and I let it sit I have  to let it sit before I blend it out and  then I like to go in with the Fenty  Contour stick this is another one of my  favorites like look at this this is just  gonna give me a nice little bronze so I  just use a little bit of it right on the  hollows of my cheek up here and then  right here just to carve out the Jawbone  so while the concealer sit I'm gonna let  it just dry a little bit so it can get a  little tacky and I'm gonna blend out  this contour and I'm using one of my  favorite brushes from Sephora this is  the Pro Foundation 70 brush I love this  Contour because it's just super warm and  I think it looks good on my melanated  skin honestly so shout out to Fenty  blend blend  now we got to blend out the concealer  use my little sponge we're gonna blend  I'm just doing light tapping motions and  this concealer is just I feel like it's  my perfect shade it brightens but it's  not too bright so it's perfect for that  everyday look what do we think so far is  it giving natural is it giving no makeup  makeup okay so we are sticking with the  cream products I'm going in with fenty's  cream blush in a daiquiri dip love this  beautiful bright color it gives all the  summer Vibes so that's why I'm really  into it and just taking a brush and I'm  just gonna put this on my cheeks and  kind of even just blend it into the  Contour just a little bit and if you  smile that just helps a lot too oh you  guys see how pigmented this is oh my  gosh we gotta blend a little bit more so  I'm using just the bum of this sponge  right here so now we are moving into the  powder product so really just going over  all of the cream products with powder so  this is the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush  bronzer absolutely love this the shade  is amazing on me I feel like really  gives me a nice bronze so I'm just gonna  go over all the spots where I put the  Fenty bronzer and then I also just like  to take a little bit and put it on my  nose and then under here we're all about  the bronzer let's just say that I love  bronzer make me look like I'm on  vacation any day so what's next is a  blush so we are using a Sephora's blush  in Hey Jealousy I'm going over the  Daiquiri color in this bright pink I've  been so into pink lately haven't you  guys I know you have this is also  pigmented too so don't need a lot but  the girls have been on the blush lately  and I'm here for it take some on the  nose I also like to sweep this on my  eyelid just give it a little bit of  color because I'm I'm not doing any eye  shadow so the last powder product that I  think you guys need because this is one  of my favorites I've been using it for  years it's the Sephora micro smooth Game  Changer this just really makes your  makeup all come together it Blends  everything really nicely and I'm just  going to use the same powder bronzer  brush and just go in and I'm gonna like  get under my eyes too the finish of this  is just really nice I feel like it  Blends into my skin so nicely so  smoothly really really seamless and it  just brings everything together so let's  get into my go-to Lippy we need a brown  liner this one is from Makeup Forever  another one of my favorites this isn't  Limitless Brown  I think every like melanated girl we  need a brown lip liner I love the way it  goes on so smooth  so I'm kind of like a 90s girl at heart  so I love anything that you know reminds  me of the 90s so I'm really into a brown  lip liner and a Plumping a lip gloss so  this one is from Sephora collection love  this and it has like a nude pinkish tone  to it so this just really reminds me of  like the 90s girl Vibe and I'm here for  it so this is pretty much the face of  course we have to set it off with a  setting spray this is a cult classic  this is the Urban Decay all-nighter  setting spray oh gee love this and we're  just gonna  list  so I'm just going to take the sponge and  just kind of like tap it in I'm just  going to bring the whole look together  and give me some more of that glow that  I love okay guys so this is the final  look it is not going to be budging in  the heat so if you guys are interested  in trying out any of the products that I  mentioned shop the Shelf below deuces  [Music],F,1648,140,5,"Jul 5,

Sephora,Sweatproof Eye Makeup Tutorial for Summer 2023 | Sephora,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSIvuOB7y8A,"flooded flood

it's summer time and we are going to talk

about makeup that is waterproof resistant to

sweat resistant to party

resistant to the beach Ok let's go the most

important thing is your skin care before

you apply makeup and that's why I'm

going with this  eye cream and I love it

because I love it I

love this creamy texture

[Music]

creamy and beautiful it

is very light and practicing

everything that I am going to teach you this is the

most important because it is a primer who

has the flu so this will help you

to your makeup that gets sticky on

your skin and will last all night

all day All summer and I'm going to

apply it first to the Behind of my hand and

just like I applied the eye cream

I'm going to do this first

touch and you are also going to apply it on

your eyelids because I am going to apply shadow

[Music]

and now I continue with concealer and I

never leave the house I never leave the

house without concealer

and I really like concealer because

I don't I don't sleep  8 hours every

night so I need a lot we're going to

wait a little and then I'm going to

blend it with my fingers because I don't have

a brush And that's okay because it's

summer

I'm going to blend

I know this shade of concealer isn't my

color but that's it  By the way, because I

love that it looks like the light

hits me and since I slept for

880 hours,

everything we already did now I'm going to

seal it with this powder and this is my

favorite Ok of all the powders that's

my favorite because it has shades  pinkish

and it also gives me more light and I look more

alive because sometimes that full and I'm going to

put the powder here

and using this little sponge that says

I'm a luxurious woman that's why I'm

using it I

'm going to paste it like this

[Music]

and also  my nose because it gets a

little greasy there and Boom

sealed dark circles Now to my eyelids and I'm going to

use this from Bobby Brown I love this

cream shadow because it's going to last all

day all night and in this pencil there are

two shades and in  this side we have more and

this shiny

This is my shade

and with this shiny

Wow Ok first I'm going to apply the match

I'm going to apply this opaque tone I

don't need a brush how easy

[Music]

another eye I

don't love to put a lot of makeup in

the summer because  it feels very heavy to

me personally and that's why I love

these and don't forget here below

now now it's cold because I'm a

star I'm

just going to apply here in the center

[Music]

shadow finished now where is the

eyeliner is here my

favorite eyeliner from

my mirror and no more I'm going to do it like this like this like



[Music] we're

done but I'm going to flood my face

with this product it's a spray of

sealer and this I love it says because

it's all I'm not going to talk because I don't

want it that  my mouth goes

[Music]

but

that's flooded ok

[Music]

finally I'm going to use mascara that is

waterproof and this and you see that

I have false eyelashes But this is

for my eyelashes down here because

when I'm outside in the  summer I

'm sweating That's where the sweat

gets greasy in here so I need something

that's waterproof Well I like

this little brush because

[Music]

it looks a lot like products But I promise

your makeup won't wash off your face

and even  next time bye

Sephora,Why I Made This with Brand Founder Shani Darden | Sephora,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsICPl35B6I,I'm Shawna Darden I'm an esthetician in  Los Angeles and the founder of Shawnee  Darden skin care  I was giving facials out of a rental  house then I created the product retinol  reform it was really stressful I had my  two kids in the beginning I started with  like 10 facials by the end I was  probably doing like 40 a week  today I have my studio in Beverly Hills  my line is in all the Sephora stores in  North America and I'm going to show you  why I made this  [Music]  growing up I lived in a small town as a  black girl where everyone was white it  was definitely a very hard time for me  for anyone having skin conditions when  you're young is so difficult I remember  I had hypopigmentation from a rash I had  had for a while  it was  really difficult  and I look back at pictures now with  makeup that didn't match my skin color  so I know firsthand what it feels like  to struggle with how you look  my Mom finally took me to a  dermatologist and that's the beginning  of my journey and love for retinol from  smoothing Fine Lines decreasing  pigmentation helping with acne it's  truly an amazing ingredient but I  couldn't find one that was gentle enough  but still powerful enough to change  someone's skin  so I went to a chemist and worked with  them on what I wanted to see what I  wanted it to do I launched my first  product retinol reform about 10 years  ago  I'm taking my best friend DJ to my back  house where I started my brand and where  I used to give facials I haven't been  here in like five years it's obviously  changed a lot this is where we are every  day all the magic so this is where I  started retinol reform and this is where  I would test all the products I'd give  them to clients right there in the  kitchen and the crazy part is that it  started that I lived inside and that was  my studio and then we moved all the way  into the house I just it seems like a  dream but I'm just so proud  I am obsessent with all things design  I wanted to design something that was me  I don't know how many bottles it's  actually changed into but I was very  specific on the bottle that I wanted  this was first I definitely put this  sticker on myself I was putting the  labels on the bottles and putting it in  the box and I was shipping the products  out for my bedroom it's been a challenge  also because I wanted a specific color  which is not apparently like a real  color it's a whole thing and then we  went into this gray bottle my favorite  bottle and then it's Square because not  a lot of people do sweat  and then when we went to Sephora we kept  the bottle but we changed the Deco so  you could read the name of the product  on the shelf and it looks so good it has  a nice weight to it yeah it just feels  Chic it just it was a long journey but  it's still my favorite bottle  Dr B one of my biggest mentors is about  to show up I can't believe she's gonna  get to see my studio I haven't seen her  in years and I'm so excited Dr Benitez  which was the dermatologist I work for  taught me everything about working hard  how to treat people having compassion oh  my God  and the majority of people that I worked  on were kids from you know 11 and up so  it was a full circle moment for me  you're An Empty Glass you were ready to  receive everything everything and look  at what it did and just being myself for  you  it just helped you be what you were  going to be anyway you were just so  caring so and I think I got that from  you  I love you thank you thank you so much  you're welcome  so proud of you my God  proud of you  my brand launched at Sephora literally  the week after the pandemic started  I started online first sephora.com the  product really started to take off  after that they really kind of guided me  through everything it was like a dream  come true that they would even take me  when I first saw my product at Sephora I  was beyond excited it's still surreal  it's been a pretty great journey with  them I do believe and when you're going  in the right direction when you find  your path and what you're supposed to do  it's just right  there's just something about skin I just  really enjoy it it was what I was  supposed to do it was always my goal to  try to give people their confidence back  that's my beauty Journey my products are  for everyone all skin tones all ages  it's just about making people feel  beautiful and that's why I made this,F,2234,123,4,"Jun 2, 2023"

Sephora,"My All-AAPI-Owned-Skincare Routine | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri7TTmTfxew,and if you come closer to the screen you  can probably smell the rice right now  it's making me low-key kind of hungry  [Music]  hi everyone my name is Wendy and some of  you guys may know me as Wendy's skin on  social media and today I'm going to be  walking you through my nighttime  skincare routine using my Holy Grail  Asian own products so before I start my  skincare routine I currently have  sunscreen on my face right now I use  sunscreen every single day this is from  Shiseido Urban environment sunscreen a  little back story this is actually one  of the first sunscreen I ever use  because my mom was always on me about  using sunscreen when I was little and  now I thank her a lot so I only have  sunscreen on my face right now and  usually using a cleanser is just not  enough to take off the sunscreen so what  I do is I go in with an oil cleanser  first just to break down all that  sunscreen first on my double cleanse I  use this cleansing oil from tatcha just  to melt away my sunscreen and all the  bacteria on my face and I just like to  rub it onto my face give myself a little  massage  skincare time is my happy time  now I'm going to wash off my cleansing  oil Just Pretend This is a sink guys  um you want to make sure that all the  cleansing oil is off your face before  you start cleansing your face with a  cleanser the second step of My Double  cleanse I'm using the tatcha rice wash  this is one of my favorite cleansers and  make sure your face is wet when you do  this  um also look I brought my minis with me  too this is always in my travel bag but  isn't it so cute it's it's like I have a  little family with me  you just want to use like a quarter size  on your face  and like I said earlier with the  cleansing oil you want to massage your  face  so it's kind of like I'm giving myself  like two massages every day which is  nice  we all deserve a little massage at the  end of the day  one of the ingredients is rice enzymes  and if you come closer to the screen you  can probably smell the rice right now  it's making me low-key kind of hungry  and I'm gonna have some rice after my  skincare routine but it also has  hyaluronic acid and I have dry skin so  this is going to hydrate your skin at  the same time too  foreign  I love this thing so much like the water  is just so good it's so fresh too  so I'm just rinsing off my face wash  right now and make sure to get all the  product off your face  um you don't want any cleanser on your  face you don't want any residue on your  face because that will make the skincare  not work after this you can finally  towel dry your face  so after I finish washing my face I'm  gonna go in with this Essence from  Shiseido I actually stole this from my  mom's bathroom and she's gonna be so mad  when she finds out but I just want to  show you my skincare routine okay it's  so good this is actually one of the  oldest products from Shiseido you want  to press this product into your skin and  you just want to make sure you get this  product everywhere because it's such a  good product and your face will love  this this product is great for hydration  and dark spots and if you look closely  on my face I have a bit of dark spots so  this is gonna help it after I do my  Essence I do my serums and now I'm going  to go in with the tatcha silk serum this  is a retinol alternative and I have like  more of a sensitive skin type so this is  a really great product to use to save  some product I like to pump on my face  instead of my hands  um so just like one dot two dots  three I mean I think this is yeah this  is enough and then you want to work it  into your face I love this product  because it also has rice inside  so it's making me extra hungry  and also for my morning routine I wanted  to show you guys my  tried and true glow recipe Dew drops I  use this in the morning I also like  using it like right before my makeup  because it gives me like that glow  um this is the jumbo size and this is  the regular  I like to keep a family with me next is  actually the last step of my skincare  routine which is moisturizer and it  doesn't matter what skin type you have  you always need moisturizer oily skin  dry skin sensitive skin acne prone  moisturizer so my favorite moisturizer  right now is the LA Niche water cream  moisturizer so this is a gel moisturizer  it's a lightweight  look at it it's so  so fun to play with too but I just like  to apply  like one spoon to my face  and after that you want to work that  into the skin and make sure you get your  entire face  moisturized what I like to do is I like  to drag down my moisturizer to my neck  because a lot of people are neglecting  your neck you should never neglect your  neck  your neck actually ages with you too fun  fact if you didn't know that  I just wanted to show you my favorite  winter moisturizer which is also the  lanaj water Bank cream moisturizer so  you can see that I finished all of it I  finished this last winter and that is  all for my nighttime routine with a bit  of my daytime favorites as well and like  I said these are all Agent Owned  products and if you're interested in any  of this you can shop the Shelf good  night  foreign  [Music],F,2447,84,8,"May 31,

Sephora,"Blush 101: Liquid vs. Cream vs. Powder Blush | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38fS5BrDxQU,"[Music]

well well it's blash season

But before we start I want to know

what you call it blash blusher Whatever

name you use it doesn't matter I'm going to

show you three types of Formula cream

liquid and powder

the first one is cream and this is so

easy  for beginners and you can

apply it with your clean finger and you can

apply it if you already have your cream foundation OR if you do

n't have makeup on but more

that it's a little bit of and it doesn't live on your

face and so look

so easy you

see the difference

and I  I apply my blush here because I

want my face to look thinner and

that's all second robot is liquid

everyone already knows this brand and

this is the liquid blush from ver Beauty

by Selena Gomez and it's a little more

difficult to apply So  I'm going to

explain how to do it. The trick to

apply this liquid is that you're going to

apply it directly to the back of your hand,

so because you're going to control the pigment,

the secret is to apply it little by little,

you see,

so blend a little more

and I love it.  rob so that's why

I want a little more of this color And you

see the brush works better Here I'm

never going to use my fingers here because

that's going to look very I don't like it with

this

[Music]

the last of the blushes is powder  and you

see that before I am going to apply this and to

my face with a transparent powder because you are

never going to apply powder on top of

cream that is not going to look good you

are also going to use a little brush again

dabs and I do like this

dabs I love this  color because it

matches my blouse

And that's powder blush I already showed you three

of the formulas cream liquid powder

you choose any blush you

like best and don't forget and I'll see you

next time bye

Sephora,Under-Eye Makeup for Beginners | Sephora Beauty Newbie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw3_BzKZdz0,so I I feel like it's trending again  dark circles I I even give myself more  dark circles a shadow like I love it it  looks mysterious but how do you feel  about it  for me personally with someone with tiny  little almond shaped eyes it's not gonna  work it's gonna be a no for me I respect  that I respect that  hi everyone I'm amaisha and I'm here  with Lucy today and we're going to show  you how to conceal your under eyes in  three easy steps so step one is always  skin care you'll always hear that for me  so investing in a good eye cream is  always really great when you're trying  to find an under eye concealer so before  we even go there we're gonna put on this  glow recipe brightening eye cream this  also has vitamin C in it so it's gonna  be really great just overall it's a  great eye cream so on the back of my  clean hand I'm gonna get a little bit  and you can apply this with your fingers  at home and really massage and push  outward so you can push any like  puffiness that you may see that's good  to know the movement of it yeah so I'm  gonna apply it  like a makeup artist would and just kind  of push out because we kind of get that  a little bit of fluid that happens under  the eye when you're at home definitely  apply your eye cream with your fingers  your ring finger I'm applying with a  brush just because I'll be using this  later and I like to sort of gently blend  outward you have a little bit of um tiny  bit of puffiness here so we're going to  take the puffiness and sort of push it  outward that's what I usually do  whenever I apply my eye cream especially  when I wake up I get that puffiness and  push it outwards since it's just a  little bit of you know fluid right there  just wipe it right off the side of your  face almost like facial massage yeah up  and out  so soothing it's like a spa moment for  me okay  okay so our under eyes are prepped we  can put a little bit of that left over  in the inner Corner if you feel like you  have some dryness there I do feel like  my dark circles extend up  to they're like full moon dark circles  it's just the shape of our faces we  naturally have a little bit of Darkness  here so we're gonna we're gonna take  care of that with a little bit concealer  cool so step two is of course covering  your under eye circles using some  concealer now when I was younger what I  would do is grab the lightest concealer  that I could possibly find and pack it  on under my eye quite heavily in this  like half moon shape and then wonder why  it wasn't concealed and it was just like  ashy so I will help you out and show you  how to use two shades just a little bit  of each to get the perfect bright under  eye so the first one we'll be using this  is a tarte concealer pretty high  coverage so you don't need very much  it's a little bit warmer of a shade so  we're gonna use two different shades one  that's a little bit peachier too color  correct and one that's a little bit  brighter to brighten and you do the  darker one first this is why I need you  in my life and you'll have a video to  re-watch yeah so I'll be using a fluffy  brush this is a Sephora collection brush  number 71.  taking a little bit  and I'm kind of blending it into the  brush before I put it on her face and  that is going to ensure that it goes on  kind of airbrushed and we're going to  put it where we see like any darkness  which would be right here  and we're just tapping and then right  around the tear duct area and you'll  kind of see that it's almost like it's  lifting and it's getting brighter  even though this is more of a peachier  shade Lucy has more of a warm undertone  wherever yellow undertones of this  peachy shade is going to work really  well to cancel out  the blueness  in the dark circle there is a little  Teensy bit  of Darkness right here  kind of common with people with almond  shaped eyes I find and just tapping it  right there kind of lifts the eye too  awake asleep okay so same corrector only  goes on the darkness  you don't want to put it on skin that's  sort of homogeneous with the rest of the  face  because you'll over color correct it you  can kind of get a little bit too much  peachiness or orange I'm just kind of  tapping it in  even just the application of it feels  like you're  butterflies more circulation right it's  like I'm gonna look more weak anyway  because  we're getting some blood flow I find too  like being gentle  um is just helpful because if you're too  rough you start to get redness and you  think you're concealing redness right  that's what I've heard about using the  ring finger right because it's the  weakest finger so you can kind of see  where I'm holding my brush if I was  holding my brush here we get a lot of  coverage oh yeah so that's also  something too wow I'm kind of mimicking  a ring finger because I'm holding my  brush back here brush position  don't forget it okay I think we're good  and I think the secret too uh with dark  circles is you don't have to conceal 100  of them to make it 100 better you can  conceal like 75 of the way sometimes  overdoing it can look overdone last step  step number three we're gonna set you  have to set your eye moves a lot your  eyes move as much as your mouth so you  want to set with a nice smooth  translucent powder this is the classic  more Mercier translucent powder  and when I set I like to have two  brushes in my hands because the eyes  move a lot as you're setting sometimes  it can settle into the creases if you're  not quick enough so before I set I like  to tap tap tap tap tap to smooth out the  concealer once more because it will  settle into uh the little texture under  the eye within a few seconds before you  set it I find that I always have that  after because I never it happens it has  never said it in my life so I'm always  like about to leave the house and  there's already lime concealer it  happens it happens uh so I like to use a  crease brush to set because it's fluffy  this is for eyeshadow  um I'm gonna dip into here  and just kind of swirl it into the top  so I can work the product in so when I  touch your face I don't just leave a big  powder dot it's super easy even though  it seems weird look up when you set your  under eye okay  because it stretches out the eye you can  get it into the little creases oh yeah  so that you know later throughout the  day you get the little concealer lines  oh yeah I know yeah this will stretch it  out so simple I would have never thought  to do that it's super easy to do when  you're doing it on yourself I promise  feels a little weird the first time but  it makes a big difference and just again  tap tap tap tap tap if you need a little  bit more you can go in so just tap tap  tap just smooth it out again and then  immediately set  [Music]  and if you are someone who wants more of  a dewy finish like hit it with some  setting spray but usually if you use  just a tiny bit of powder  still look prehydrated  and that's it concealed under eyes  okay you've waited patiently so let me  show you I think you look great oh my  gosh yeah that is such a difference yeah  especially with the setting powder yeah  and it still it looks like skin it  doesn't look like we overly

Sephora,"Pro Makeup Artist Kit Must-Haves | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7FBolNzrtY,when I'm like doing photo shoots is when  I see skin that's glowy dewy glass skin  dolphin skin whatever else you're  calling it and the body's so dry it  breaks my heart  so Helen and I have known each other a  very long time we've both been  professional makeup artists for a long  time we've worked alongside each other  for about 13 years yeah 13 years and one  of my I know oh grannies uh one of my  favorite things is looking into Helen's  kit and seeing what she has like what  she's really loving what tension  moisture she's into what pigment she's  currently using and she does the same  with me so we're going to share with you  some of our must-haves she has some like  tips for me that she hasn't showed me so  I'm very excited about that but yeah  some some great things for you all  whether you're a makeup Enthusiast or  make a professional or just someone who  likes to you know learn the tricks of  the trade alright so let's dive into the  thing that I feel like everybody always  talked about when we were learning  makeup is skin prep skin prep skin prep  if your palette doesn't look good your  makeup's not gonna look good so this is  the Lawless forget the filler overnight  lip Plumping mask and this has quickly  become one of my favorites it doesn't  have a color to it it plumps with a  little bit of Menthol it is super  hydrating it's greater makes the lips  look smoother yeah  that's really key I feel like we're  always trying to add tons of hydration  create the smoothest palette possible if  you have to change the lip color a lot  this is great for that it's like an easy  touch up in between because one of the  most important things or one of the  first things I learned when I joined the  Sephora Pro Artistry team if you only  have 10 minutes to do makeup sometimes  even five still spend like 20 percent of  your time hydrating the skin if you have  to choose between like a great eye and  maybe your foundation doesn't look so  good because it's a little bit  dehydrated or gray skin Foundation  laying perfectly and like eyeliner is a  little wonky you're going to choose that  like great hydrated skin every time so  yeah um prep is like 50 of our job for  sure truly okay so I think this is kind  of universal for makeup Artistry the pet  peeve that I have  especially when I'm like doing photo  shoots is when I see skin that's glowy  dewy glass skin dolphin skin whatever  else you're calling it and the body's so  dry it breaks my heart mixed texture  yeah yeah I don't like discrepancies  just don't like it one of my favorite  things to use is SPF Body Oil it's like  my little secret because SPF reflects  ever so slightly so it makes you look  glowy and luminous but there's no  flashback because it's oil so it's  translucent it's transparent this is  from K skin this is the aisle Body Oil  SPF 30. if you know anything about case  skin when you Harlow being the founder  she's a model and she needs to wear SPF  protection she does a lot of like photo  shoots outside and stuff so it's no  flashback she looks gorgeous like just  cover yourself head to toe in this and  the fact that it won't transfer on  anything there's no makeup there's no  Shimmer Shimmer can look like sparkly  dandruff I've seen it I've done shoots  I'm so excited to see yeah sparkly  dandruff and I'm like oh no so look into  an SPF body all you have to wear it  anyway I just love glow glow glowy  hydra's gamingster work look better and  people feel really good so my favorite  thing to get I call it like Rich Lady  Skin luxurious skin oh it's so good so  this is straight from my kit it's all  Shartel Berry  sorry we bought her sharp sharper in  private  all Charlotte Tilbury you can you can  see now Flawless filter Flawless filter  is amazing if you ever see an editorial  shoot and the the model just looks like  they have bare skin but it almost looks  like it's that nice little glow or sweat  after a workout but beautiful yeah  athletic skin for sure this is what it  does let's see let's get a deeper color  so you can really see it on my skin uh  this is shade five this is so  [Music]  so this gives you  the most beautiful glow it's not a  foundation it's like a complexion  booster or enhancer yeah I think when I  saw it at first I was like oh there's so  many shades it's a foundation yeah no  it's not you can see how reflective and  beautiful that is oh it looks so good it  just gives you this beautiful look if  you have freckles I've used this on  models with freckles before just  beautifully evens out their skin and  gives it a glow it just looks cohesive  under makeup on top of it mixed into  like it's one of my favorite things I  don't think I ever do any makeup without  this any skin type I love the music  yes now they have even more shades than  you have to go I love it  that's amazing well I have definitely  used that product before and I used it  with this brush that you know that I use  for everything I'm like oh just get get  the number 98 brush wait where is it  oh it's here oh my God  I have hundreds of these on my kit it's  stupid how many this is the number 98  brush I use it for pretty much  everything you can set your under eye  with it you can apply foundation with it  you kind of highlighter highlighter I've  done like a full eye look with this by  like pinching the edges on set you know  I don't have time doing like little  extended Eye Lift look it's just it does  everything I love like a small to medium  sized brush and it just works really  well for blending I have  because you didn't know like when uh  pretty much like any brushes that have  come out in the past like 10 years at  Sephora like we've tested personally and  said like we like this we don't like  this like you know my eyes are small my  eyes are large this works really well  for makeup Artistry so like all the  brushes that you see that's a part of  this before collection range are all  tested by us I still have some that  still have like the like lab number on  them absolutely love I'm like these are  amazing I love them so even don't pay  attention to the name just use it for  use it for whatever that's what I do  with this I truly use it for everything  and I like it because it can really like  fit in to like the nooks and crannies of  your face you know wherever you want it  to go I think one of the big things when  you're shooting is like oh they look  shiny and it's like truly like just a  little spot there then I'm only gonna  you know mattify that area I wouldn't do  like a dusting everywhere so I feel like  this really helps with strategic  powdering and just anything really yeah  so nice okay so oh I have  I I just I love this next thing I know  you love it too  absolute must-have for anybody's kit  um when you have a kit like if we had my  actual kit like it's over there  somewhere it's like 60 pounds yeah heavy  and I have a smaller kit that I have to  use when I'm traveling and you have to  have things where you can think on your  feet like my worst fear is not having  mustard yellow lipstick if a client  requests it I need to be able to make it  these are from danessa myricks and these  are the color fix pigments now when  you're deciding what to get if you're  someone who wants to be able to have  like Endless Possibilities I suggest  getting primary colors your yellow your  red your blue if you know anything about  color theory and if you don't you can  you know easily look it up there's so  many resources you can mix any color you  want remember we had to do that  challenge where we had to literally like  create Foundation now it's like coming  out that a lot of people are doing that  but I think it's so funny because we  definitely have it a little bit about  yes segment into our history when we  were on the priority team we had to do  these auditions and we had to do these  ridiculous not ridiculous because they  were like they were challenging in a  good way like these challenges were we  had to like mix our own foundations from  pigments we had to do a smokey eye with  a cotton bud and lipstick I would say  once you have your primary colors you  can make anything you want and then you  add in a black and white so you can  shade and tinted into like whatever  intensity you want to and then I would  say get a glitter get a glitter so you  can change the Finish  I use a nice solution everything get a  glitter yeah that's also like a pro tip  like if you make a mistake just put  glitter on it because the camera can't  capture the mistake it just  yeah I absolutely love these I'm so  happy we have these pigments because I  could just carry this yeah and mascara  so much I'm good to go you can mix it  into a foundation to you can use it it's  color corrector mix it with oil mix it  with serum do whatever you want all  right I'm so glad you brought your  Janessa pigments because I have a  personalized palette for you I don't  know what it is but I want to buy it I  support a question Sephora collection  makes this amazing supplement case and  what looks like a supplement case to you  is actually a personalized palette for  your model so I love this because it has  obviously an area where you can mix  Shades together if you want but I like  it because I can put like lip balm in  here their lipstick touch up maybe  they're like cheek color if they have  some kind of like a cream cheek color  um I even put powder in there sometimes  it's just a really great thing to have  on set that's individualized to your  model six things yes yeah and you have a  million like little you know palettes or  whatever million little lipsticks like  rolling around in your touch kit it's  just so much easier to have this with  you so I just really love this and you  know let's just show show the people how  it works mixing I really love it if you  don't have pink cream eyeshadow guess  what guess what you do now you do you  can create a pink  cheek color all right let's do that so  you do a tiny bit of red  and then you know more white or whatever  and then just mix it up until you get  the shade you want and that's like a  great a great color that you could  easily throw on a Model to like on their  cheeks to get it to be like a really  Rosy cheek color and if you're doing  under painting you know that's a really  like  too if you want to throw yeah in the  when you're an artist like not having  something at least for me I get so  nervous you're good this is so smart  this is so smart and I do feel like it's  changed my life because I feel like I've  have multiple models on set a lot like  everyone gets around look it doesn't  when you close it this is the best part  it does not touch like these things so  you're not like it's not mucking up the  rest of the yeah you could like that's  so smart it's really great oh I love  this it's a game changer all right well  I feel like we could talk endlessly  about kits and makeup and just dive  right into it again and again  um if you love anything from your kit  and you really want to share please let  us know we love hearing about new  products it is we're not even joking we  will get so interested in buy it so as  always if you want to uh look at any of  the products that we've talked about  today you can shop the Shelf below  they're all listed there and I feel like  we need to do another one of these if  you want to see another one let us know  because this was so much fun so much fun  bye,F,5068,253,12,"May 10, 2023"
Sephora,"Why I Made This with Brand Founder Chris Collins | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4u91pwUFV0,my fragrance Journey started when I was  about six or seven years old my dad  always took pride in smelling good  that's where my connection to fragrance  was born my dad is not with us anymore  but I can still remember how he smells  it becomes like this emotional  connection  I've launched my brand in 2018 after I  created my first scent I had to go into  building what the DNA of the brand would  feel like that's how I lost the paradise  was born  it's my brand story and I cannot wait to  share it with you I want to pull back  the curtain to show you why I made this  [Music]  I'm Chris Collins the founder of world  of Chris Collins  growing up we didn't have a whole lot of  money to me fragrance was always that  thing to make me feel luxurious and made  me feel confident I remember my first  job when I got my first check the first  thing I did was buy a fragrance  at the time I was a little nervous  because it took my whole check but it  was probably the most important purchase  that I ever made in my life it  foreshadowed what's happening now  foreign  fashion for a long time maybe like 20  plus years and I ended up meeting a  perfumer who taught me about the  creative process of fragrance at the  time I was just like a fragrance nerd  and collected and I've always wanted to  create my own I just never knew how he  was gracious enough to kind of show me I  knew there was a void in the fragrance  space that needed to be filled and I  wanted to create my own brand  four and a half years ago here in Harlem  the idea was born it was important to  tell the story of the Harlem Renaissance  The Rebirth of Black Culture fragrance  was my contribution to that at the time  there was very little representation  there was not it took a lot of people  around me to say you can do this and you  know I knew it was important  now meeting with my packaging designer  to go over samples logos and sketches  for loss of paradise I knew I wanted to  do something different and it was my  opportunity to bring in the white bottle  which I love that we designed early and  it fit because loss of paradise is more  fresh there's coconut water in it  definitely more tropical you want to be  more inviting right your brand grew like  really quickly this is an important part  of packaging it's like how do you  differentiate between your scents  although white was perfect we still kept  the black around the interior because I  still wanted it to pop  most of my fragrances are very masculine  this is probably the most kind of unisex  leaning almost feminine I wanted this to  kind of be  for everyone the perfumer Jerome epinet  he really helped me kind of bring that  idea and that story to light  I think even if we have thousands of  ingredients available so it's like a  painter you have a style you have a  signature there's a dance between me and  the perfumer and we work on it together  to kind of get to where I would like the  fragrance to be the laboratory yes once  you put together the recipe we can hear  yes I send the recipe the formula here  and then once they're done compounding  the spring need a little sample that we  smell  so the coconut water is natural it's an  extract of the real coconut the way for  instance are made you come up with a  scent which is made up of multiple notes  If lost in Paradise is the song the  notes are the lyrics it's what speaks to  you like the coconut and the passion  fruit and the Wild Orchid so once you  get that part done then you have to  blend it which is usually an alcohol and  it's antioxidants that goes into it so  you know it can be healthy for people to  put on their skin  we're going to my manufacturer to visit  where my fragrances are Blended and  macerated so one of the things we talked  about in the blending process is me  switching over to sugarcane alcohol we  are actually importing sugarcane alcohol  direct from Brazil the organic sugar  cane is non-GMO so it's cleaner for you  I have to agree we never launch a  fragrance until it macerates for at  least 30 days and then at that point  then you bottle it and package it and  then it's ready to go on the Shelf here  we are in our production area so down  here is where we do all the blending  blending before we filter okay now let  me show you the other section where  we're going to do the filling okay  [Music]  we bring your solution and it's filtered  then we're going to bring it here to  fill capped cleaned and then we'll box  them okay  [Music]  when it came time to launch it was a  very proud moment for me this was mine  this was my story  since launch I've created 12 fragrances  which to me is like mind-blowing we've  launched in so many incredible major  retailers and of course Sephora which  has been an incredible partner for me it  can be intimidating for you know smaller  Brands like myself to partner with  Sephora and they said Chris will go as  fast or as slow as you want we're going  to support your brand because we believe  in your brand I'm really happy with the  forza retailer Sephora's values and my  Brand's value is really aligned  especially with Sephora's position on  being more inclusive and more diverse  I hope I can inspire a little black boy  or girl who never thought it was  possible to be in fragrance let alone  have a brand that it's possible,F,1813,118,12,"May 5, 2023"
Sephora,"What I’ve Learned from Celebrity Beauty Brand Founders | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWVTArt047g,[Music]  hi gorgeous hi Carla I'm so happy to be  here with you hello hi I'm Carly  Cassandra and this is what I've learned  from Brand Founders so I'm the content  creator here at Sephora and within the  pandemic we wanted to give you content  that you could watch at home while we're  on lockdown so we started a live show  called Beauty chat room that they asked  me to host it's given me the opportunity  to interview so many brand Founders and  a lot of them are celebrities and it's  given me an opportunity to learn so much  from them and so I want to share it with  you okay so to start I think I can call  her my best friend at this point today  we have a very  special guest that means no intro but  I'm gonna let her give an intro anyway  that's you welcome I am Selena Gomez  founder of rare Beauty so the reason why  she named her brand rare is because she  really wanted her fans and her people to  really celebrate their unique beauty and  she also wanted to create a brand that  was accessible to everybody whether you  were a beauty junkie or whether you were  someone that wanted to keep it really  simple and something I really love about  Selena's personality is she's just so  warm and I think a lot of her names of  her products reflect that so this right  here is always an optimist setting spray  this I love I love any kind of setting  spray or anything I can like prep my  makeup with and I love this so much  especially during the hotter moments and  I live in Los Angeles now and it's I  feel like it's always hot here so you  can stick this in the fridge and give  yourself a nice little pick me up during  the day because everyone loves a missed  opportunity another brand founder that  I've interviewed a few times is Vicki  Tsai of tatcha thank you thank you so  much for coming on and joining us thank  you for having me there's nowhere else  I'd rather be right now  what I really love is she makes her skin  care more of a gratitude ritual and so  when she's taking off her makeup at the  end of the day or whatever's on her skin  it's like taking off negativity and when  she's putting on all her skin care  products like the water cream she's  really putting on gratitude and just  being so grateful for whatever is in her  life at that moment so I've taken that  with me in kind of my everyday and it  really does help you to just have a lot  of Zen in your life the next founder is  a Mario devanovic AKA makeup by Mario  who is a celebrity makeup artist there  he is oh my gosh I'm so excited  hey everyone hi Carla yes I'm excited to  be doing this live with you you look so  beautiful by the way thank you I had to  bring it for you he has these soft  sculpt contouring sticks which are  amazing it's a cream Contour I'm the  type of person who would put this on and  put it everywhere but what he said to do  is when you apply it and you blend it  out with the brush that's on the other  end whatever is left on the excess of  the brush use that on your chin your  nose and all the places you don't want  super heavy product and what you may not  know which he taught me in the live is  you can twist this and pop this off so  that you can clean the brush without  getting any product wet the next founder  did not birth me but I call her mother  and I think we all do there she is here  I am she needs no introduction but if  you don't know who she is you guys  mother Pat McGrath is on this is a Pat  McGrath this is the skin fetish Divine  blush all her products are really  Artistry based and you can basically do  anything with them the thing I love  about this if you read it on the back it  says blush without caution and what that  means is basically she's created these  products to blush how you want to if  you're someone who likes to apply your  blush more lightly like me you can do  that or you can really intensify it and  keep building it the moment I knew that  I made it in my career was when I was  able to interview Lady Gaga I call her  Stephanie because we're on a first name  basis now I couldn't have become who I  am day without having access to not only  a range of colors but the ability to  express myself and be inspired and she  created a brand that really wanted to  celebrate the colors of the rainbow and  the colorful life she's lived so you  could wear these alone because it's an  Artistry driven brand you can also mix  them which is what I'm gonna do right  here with my little palette that's  tucked back here and we're gonna take  some of this fuchsia and I love a pink  it's very OB which stands for on-brand  for me and then I'm gonna take some of  this white you can see it's a little bit  of that pink that fuchsia and that white  and you know I'm just gonna do this with  my fingers and it's just gonna blend  really beautifully  and this is literally probably my  favorite shade of pink like how pretty  that is so what's great about being able  to mix these pigments is you can create  colors that you might not even be able  to find one of the biggest full circle  moments of not just my career but my  life was interviewing JLo I know her as  Jen now because we're on a first name  basis congratulations on everything  thank you and you look gorgeous you know  people grow along with you and they  watch you they watch you fall down they  go oh what you doing huh this is going  up and badly  they start going okay well she's not  giving up maybe I shouldn't either I  went through that I went through this  what she taught me was something that I  will carry with me for the rest of my  life we all talk about the JLo glow and  to her it's not necessarily about how  you glow it's about how you fail how you  make mistakes how you fall down and how  you lean into adversity and how you make  it to the other side once going through  all those things and that's what makes  you glow so I'm gonna carry that with me  forever and another thing I'm going to  carry with me forever is the JLo booty  bomb I know this is a booty bomb and I  have a lack thereof however  you can also use this not just on your  booty but all over your body this is  really going to help to tighten your  skin so you can do this on your arms  your legs anywhere that you need that  nice and tight firming so obviously  that's only some of many Founders that  I've been able to interview and that  have taught me so much in life and I  wish I could share them all with you but  you can watch us on beauty chat room so  make sure you tune in and if you want to  grab any of these products from these  Founders that I now call friends make  sure you shop

Sephora,"How Editorial Makeup Can Inspire an Everyday Look | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjNxAi_LlcY,hi I'm David and I'm not teaching you  how to do this today I'm going to show  you how to get this  [Music]  hi everyone I'm David I'm here at my  beautiful model Jade how are you I'm  good how are you you look incredible  we were playing around with makeup I  created this stunning editorial look on  Jade because she's so easy to put makeup  on but you said something really fun to  me what did you say I think this look is  amazing but I would not be able to wear  it anywhere and that's a really common  thing with the work that I do often  makeup looks like this I'm pushing the  boundaries of Beauty for runways or for  magazine editorials and it's really  there to inspire but a lot of times  people will see this look and think well  am I supposed to recreate that and no  I'm not teaching you how to recreate  that today in fact what this video is is  I'm going to show you how you can look  at something like this and then pull  bits of it to create a look more  customized for your own lifestyle  something that you still feel fabulous  but you can also still go and meet your  friends with so stick around okay so we  have taken Jade's eyes and lips down  reset them we've let her hair loose  we're going for more comfortable casual  and we're gonna recreate a look based on  that editorial look but something that  you could wear every day and I'm going  to start with the product that I used on  the eyes before because I absolutely  love it this is a new product it's from  Kofi this is the Zari eyes cream  eyeshadow obsessed with this stuff  really cool colors really fun really  easy to use and we're just gonna play  with this that's exactly what editorial  is it's playing with textures and tones  and I fell in love with this chartreuse  color it's so beautiful so I'm gonna  have you clothes for me  and I'm going to be using a small  Sephora Pro 15 Brush and I'm going to  blend this just over her lid such a  beautiful color it's called chamak  Challo and this was one of those things  that stood out in that editorial look  was really playing with a bold color  like this that's got this great Sheen to  it it's the moment in and of itself is  this eyeshadow I absolutely love it just  blending this softly up right to her  crease I'm taking that bold intensity of  the editorial I'm pulling elements from  it and I'm simplifying it there's a gold  Shimmer running through all these  shadows I'm just in love with that and I  think it's so beautiful and so  Innovative and that made for a really  great editorial moment but as you can  see also something really fun and easy  you can wear  also Jade this color on your skin is  oh God it's so good  oh my God I absolutely love it like  obsessed with this okay so now I'm gonna  go into another color this is a really  fun blue tone it's called disco dreams  so I'm gonna be using this but I'm gonna  use it slightly different than we did in  the original in the original I had it  you know going through the inner crease  sometimes it's nice to simplify an  editorial look and that's what gives it  a wearable daytime effect so I'm gonna  have you look up and this is actually  going to be our bottom color  so we're gonna run this right under the  eye  creating almost a two-tone smokey eye we  basically simplify we took the colors  that we saw in that really over the top  editorial look and instead of trying to  find the exact placement I did before  you can simply split them use one on top  one on the bottom and then you've got a  simplified look that still pulls from  and is inspired by that really cool  editorial vibe same thing on this side  [Music]  say these eyeshadows are like butter  they are so smooth to go on that's why I  blew it out of proportion because I'm  just enjoying blending them it feels  smooth too it's right it does it's so  soft and you know this really goes back  to a lot of times when I'm talking about  editorial makeup in general and people  say well where am I gonna wear it I like  to use this this analogy of like a  restaurant you go to a really cool  Progressive restaurant with all this  like Fusion food and stuff like you try  all this really cool stuff you're not  gonna go home and cook all that right no  but you might get inspired by a spice or  a flavor or a vegetable and that's what  you incorporate into your jelly life  that's what we're doing here we're  taking bits and pieces of the editorial  work and we're creating something a  little bit more fun I'm gonna pop  mascara on we're gonna finish off the  eye and I'm going to show you how to  apply a lip that works with this the  same way that lip did in the editorial  look okay so for lip we're gonna tone it  down we're not gonna go as dark I'm  going to be using from Simi Haze this is  the Velvet blur matte lip balm these are  really lightweight matte Shades and this  is a really cool Brown tone and so I'm  gonna have you I'm gonna apply it here  and then I'm just gonna have you  your lips together once we have it on  because we're going to use this as just  a really loose base because we want to  add some color to the left and we want  it to be really soft but it's not as  dark as it was and that can in itself  just lightening up the lip a little bit  that color you know making it a little  bit brighter a little bit lighter makes  it a little bit more wearable  you could just kind of rock this lip in  general but I do love the mixture of the  Shimmer on the eye with more of a matted  skin and a glossy lip so we're going to  add some gloss I'm going to be using the  one size and this is actually a dual  ended lip product which is really cool  it's got a liquid lipstick here so a  matte liquid lipstick and then a really  cool pretty gloss I'm just gonna use the  gloss because I really wanted this brown  tone here  and this is going to be our topper for  our lip and it's going to give us a  really cool inspiration from our  editorial look but much more wearable  because it won't be so dark  really beautiful shade we're not using a  lip liner we're keeping this a little  bit more softer easy quick to do are you  ready to see a jade yes take a look what  do you think  okay so now where would you wear this  I'm going out tonight for dinner there  you go there you go I hope this was  inspiring for all of you to look at  editorial makeup in a different way and  realize that you can pull from it what  you like and what works for your  lifestyle and your personal style in  general so if you loved any of these  products and I think you should shop the  shelf and until next time check out some  editorial looks and make them your own  and let me see bye everyone  [Music],F,2076,115,18,"Apr 26, 2023"
Sephora,"Sephora Gente: Beginner’s Guide to Eyeshadow Brushes | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuneLv5mGkA,"well defined well pretty well beautiful

these four brushes are all

you need to create any

eyeshadow look in this beginners guide i

show you how My name is Jessi and I am the

I love these shades and I love the quality of

this palette This is the one for  Batman is one

of the mothers that she has beautiful.

Let's start with the brush that I love

to use to put the color on the

entire eyelid and it is number 14 of the

Sefora Collection. This brush is

quite dense and helps you to place that

color without any kind of  problems and without

having to repeat that step many times you

saturate the tip of the brush

and I use the brush in this way

so that the product does not fall in the

area under the eyes

press little by little so that you saturate

the eyelid

do not forget to give it  dab firmly

now with what's left of the brush

I'm going to rotate the brush and use it

like this to blend a bit if you

notice the look is complete with that

base color But it needs a little dab

to make it look more blended and  It looks

more uniform I will be using the

brush number 27 from sefora Collection

to achieve this you place the product on

the tip and shake it to remove the

excess and usually when I pick up

a lot of pigment that looks like this I take my

hand and check how much I have  so that it

is not too much in the eye but if you look

even in the hand it starts to look very

soft you

place the brush in front



of the Basin and where you want

that color to be deposited is where you are going to put

the brush first if  look at the

brush is clean when it is like

this I begin to blend the

outer areas so that it looks much

more natural

little by little and you place this brush

gently on the face and it will look

much more evenly distributed when

You see my eyes are missing a touch of

color under the lashes I'm going to take

the number 15 brush and since this one has

much shorter and more

compact bristles it will help me deposit that

color so that it looks uniform and give it

detail I'm going to  use the same color that

I used on the eyelid and I go little by

little applying that color

to saturate it with the same color

and I am going to give a little more to the line

of the upper lashes so that it

looks more defined

to give it intensity I am going to take a

little  of the dark tone and place it in

the same area I see that I need a

little sparkle in this corner to create the

perfect symmetry and you end up with a look

like this Now if you look, I have the same little

brush in my hands and it is because this

brush is ideal for applying  glitter and

to apply that desired light in certain

areas that are smaller in the eye

I am going to use the same one that is number

15 to pick up a little bit of this

glitter

in Puerto Rico we call it glitter but I

know it is glitter

or frost I shake the  excess you can use your

fingers too but this

brush is ideal let's start I'm going to

place it in the very center to give it

that super wat look as a medium Ferry

How cute and if you look at a swipe that

color that shine is exact they

looked cute no

Wow  this gloss is everything

and I'm going to place it at the bottom

so it looks even like this Everything looks

so beautiful on the skin and it feels like a

soft

delicious formulation And finally

we want to give it that dimension and that

detail That's why I go to the eye  I'm going to be

using the Collection brush

number 22, these are angular, it's compact and it's going to

help you define that lash line.

Take your product. In

this case, I'm going to take this shadow that's

a little darker.

And if you notice when I pick it up

I'm going little by little by tapping the product

Look at the excess, one of the things I

always do on my hand

Look how it looks super defined for this one

I'm going to get a little closer to the mirror

But the idea is that I put it close to

the eyelashes  and start dabbing

If you want to extend it, the good thing is that

this brush already has the shape of an

eyeliner All you have to do is

place it and slide it into the

eye

and I turn the brush when I am in the

area near the tear duct I turn the

brush  on that side so that the

fine tip is closer and the color can be seen from thin

to wider. Look how beautiful

the definition of the brush is when it makes

that outline and the best thing about this

brush is that it not only works with

powder shadows as well  work with

cream products well defined well pretty

well beautiful as you can see with

these four essential brushes you can

achieve any shadow look you

want if you loved them don't forget

you can Shut the Show see you soon

Sephora,Makeup and Skincare Tips for Eczema Flare-Ups | Sephora,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EAHqCIMP8,eczema Queens if you're the eczema queen  that I'm the eczema princess go ahead  I'm much older than you  [Music]  hey everyone I'm Aisha and I'm hope and  today we're going to be talking about  Eczema yes yes I recently had a flare-up  I just have some questions yeah as we  were chatting we kind of realized we  both had like similar but very different  uh issues with our eczema we I think we  get it in different places yeah so today  we're going to be talking about some of  our favorite tips combined on how we  look really polished and we're having a  flare-up so anybody who has eczema  rosacea any kind of skin condition where  your skin gets Tight and Dry they  already have a favorite moisturizer yes  uh so go ahead and use whatever you love  but something you can add to your  routine uh Tower 28 SOS spray it has  hypochlorous acid and water I even use  this on my baby's butt when he gets dirt  brush that's how soothing it is uh it's  certified by the national eczema  Association so that was like enough  right there and it's definitely been a  part of my routine ever since so use it  before and use it continuously  throughout the day so more than once so  before you put on your moisturizer any  other skin care and then I like to have  the little baby one here that's why I  have here throw this in my bag and just  kind of Spritz throughout the day I'm  going to go ahead and do this  that feels so good it's amazing anybody  who's ever told me about this like they  absolutely love it okay so when I have a  breakout myisha I like to use uh  concealer but I go easy on the  foundation or I skip it all together  because I don't want to highlight that  texture right yeah yeah yeah it's like  very hard to get away from the texture  uh so the best bet is using something  hydrating like yeah concealer here that  is nice and hydrating and using a little  teensy teensy bit yeah don't use a lot  uh the more you put on the more texture  you may see so I'm just going to get a  little bit in the back of my sanitized  hand and I'm actually using  um an eyeshadow brush this is the pro  crease brush number 26 because it's  fluffy it'll kind of Glide over any  texture hope doesn't really have  anything going on around her eyes but I  tend to get that yeah really badly  around my eyes where it just looks  really crepey and dry and I find too by  using an eyeshadow brush it kind of  Wicks away a little moisture from the  product so I don't really have to use  powder because powder there's another  thing that's going to make me look a  little bit drier yeah I think for me  when I have a breakout I want to work  with my skin I don't want to like work  against it the eczema breakout and  sometimes it's about choice you might  not um be able to wear the exact same  thing you wear every day and have it  look the way you expect it to look but  just kind of like touching up here and  there bringing on some of the redness a  little bit of the pigmentation is  usually enough just to make you look  nice and bright  all right so we've applied concealer  lightly kind of buffed it into that  moisturizer it looks great yeah and now  we're going to be talking about blush I  think blush is not something you really  think about yeah you have eczema I think  like some of you were like what but uh  dead skin cells are not the same color  as your skin they're like this white  translucent color yeah they look ashy  yeah and when they build up especially  on a deeper skin tone they just look  gray and you just look washed out  sometimes you just need like a mood  boost yes  so you need a little bit of blush and  sometimes if your cheeks are flared up  you need a cream blush that is nice and  just smooth so this is from rare Beauty  a little goes a long way I think these  have been around Long yeah so we all  know that I like to put a little bit on  the back of my hand that's enough for  like the whole week and I take a brush  and just work a little bit into the  brush if you have any redness associated  with your skin condition maybe you have  a little bit of rosacea you just want to  be a little bit lighter with this and  kind of work with the flush yeah  sometimes my breakouts are red  so it's nice to like kind of even out  the redness if that makes sense yeah  work with it this is where you had a  little bit of your redness so we're kind  of working with it we don't want to over  blush you yeah where it looks obvious  but um  yeah just adding a little bit more  because as the day goes on and your  concealer kind of wears away you also  want your flush to kind of work for you  yeah and this so This cheek was actually  like more red than this one so it's like  sometimes you have to even it out use  less product on one cheek and vice versa  yeah for sure so the next thing I want  to talk about is eye makeup I've had  lots of times where I've had like a  week-long two week long flare-up back  when I work in store especially wearing  makeup all the time or even like when we  were filming at home and I had to wear  eyeshadow and I just find a creamy  eyeshadow works so well and it's almost  like kind of glitter fixes everything  you hear people say that a shimmery one  also kind of diffuses uh because I get  this like almost like alligator skin  texture around my eyes when it happens  so I really love the Charlotte Tilbury  so this isn't a shade champagne oh  that's so pretty so so pretty yeah  um it just like adheres to the eye  really well it kind of takes the place  of an eye primer too I think we should  put glitter fixes everything glitter  fixes everything on a poster on a  t-shirt a poster in my kitchen so I'm  going to use the same brush I use for  the concealer and we're just going to  add a little bit on the lid it just  gives a little bit of softness not you  know super necessary but I always found  that I just wanted to disguise that  textured skin I had on my eyelid during  a flare-up and I don't really get  flare-ups on my eyes but sometimes I  want to bring the focus somewhere else  somewhere else yeah yeah yeah like don't  look at my cheeks don't look at my chin  and then on the flip side sometimes I  would get sort of swelling because of my  Eczema and I would do the opposite I  would do a deeper color in more of like  a satin finish because that would kind  of  take it down a little bit and then I'll  wear my glasses and all kinds of little  tricks here there's no science all kinds  of little things but that looks really  pretty it looks like skin it's going to  act like a highlighter like a face  highlighter but it's going to stay put  and locked down all day so it's not  going to go anywhere so lastly I feel  like oh my God there's nothing worse  than like chapped lips when you have a  flare-up don't talk too much do not  they're just like next level dry so  obviously skip the mat anything like  just don't do it  um and just invest in a lip oil or lip  balm or lip mask or something we have  the house lap one right here I went with  this peachy shade to kind of go with the  blush but it's just going to be  hydrating again like the tower 28 mini  just keep this with you and just put it  on yeah all day and honestly if Lady  Gaga makes it true  I'm gonna get it It's gotta be good it  has a very slate tent and I like lip  oils because again same concept is shiny  if you have any texture going on it kind  of diffuses you can't really see what's  going on and adding that little bit of  color  um because like the cheeks kind of like  all the color leaves my lips they kind  of turn a little bit grayish washed out  so it just adds a little bit of  something  how do I look you look great glowy and  ethereal no flare-ups I need immunity  okay yeah let's see  okay  like pretty oh yes again we worked with  the skin I feel like you're gonna have  to start wearing that eye color it's  very pretty it's very it's giving glow  lots of glow oh and I'm hydrated like  it's it this would not if I were having  like a dry patch outbreak but not  highlighted comfortable it's flexible  you still look really glowy yeah plush  hopefully these tips help you if you're  having a flare-up you don't have to hide  inside your house like you know I used  to do that all the time avoid things  um but you can definitely look amazing  and feel amazing go ahead and check out  these products shop the Shelf below and  we'll see you next time bye bye

Sephora,"How to: Contour and Highlight the Décolletage | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsYiFQiICuw,and then give us a little pop there for  a second and then boom when you do that  you get that really nice so while you're  dancing everyone's gonna be like hang  your skin look good  I love it  [Applause]  [Music]  hey everyone I'm David I'm here with my  beautiful model Jade how are you I'm  good how are you I'm doing great this  video we're going to show you how to  make sure that your event season makeup  not only is gorgeous on your face but  also your decolletage your neck your  shoulders I mean exhibit a we want you  to look gorgeous so let's Jump Right In  because I got a few tips and tricks that  are going to show you exactly how to do  that okay so Jade's face is gorgeous the  makeup is snatched she's ready for an  event it's glowing it's beautiful but we  need to make sure that the decolletage  the shoulders those areas match as well  and that's a really important and key  factor in making sure that your look is  complete so when we're creating that  type of look on the face it always  starts with skin prep it's essential so  we're going to do the same thing for  Jade's body so I'm I'm going to start by  using this really great product from  Fenty skin which we love and this is the  pre-show glow this is a really iconic  product used by all the Fenty makeup  artists Backstage on models to get that  skin ready and use it all over comes  with this really handy little cloth that  sits on your hands and it's a 10 aha  which is an alpha hydroxy acid great for  resurfacing bringing about your Skin's  Natural Glow because it's removing all  the dead dull skin cells that sit on the  surface and this is really fast it takes  a few seconds you see and already you  can start seeing her skin is looking  brighter more Vivid richer and already  there's a beginning of a glow starting  so we're gonna add a general moisturizer  just one that I love for the body and  then we're going to come back and I'm  going to show you how to sculpt okay so  now we're gonna go into our first step  which is contouring I'm going to be  using the Patrick top this is the sculpt  Duo a great product it's actually got  two formulas in here a cream and a  powder the cream is protected by a  little plastic cover which I love and  I'm going to be applying that with a  Sephora Pro foundation brush number 56  because I want something a little  smaller and denser and I'm going to  start with the cream  so I'm going to be picking up  some of the cream product you don't need  a lot of this now here's a really fun  little trick if you will where where do  we Contour right it's the same thing  with the face when you're thinking about  contouring your face do you do this face  chair when you go  okay right we all do that when we're  looking at contour and then we go  we do the fish face  so that reason we do that is we're  sucking in so that we can see the inside  and the undercarriage of our cheekbone  the way to find the bones on your  clavicle to bring out your bone jewelry  as I like to call it yeah exactly is you  just bring the shoulders in a little bit  and all of a sudden it pops it and you  can see exactly where  your Contour goes so with your brush I'm  going to have you just sort of pop in a  little bit there there we go we're going  to take that it sinks right under the  bone there the same way it does in the  cheek like that area and look you start  to see it's really starting to enhance  so remember with this it's less is and  more and also when you're working with  the cream it's gonna look a little bit  intense from the beginning don't forget  we are going to be using a powder over  and powder will always soften everything  so it's really about just keeping it  really gentle you can also Contour the  neck sometimes people like to do that I  like to come down like three quarters on  the side of the neck  so not all the way on the side and not  too far in the middle  and again I'm using a little bit because  this is cream and cream is very intense  looking so a little goes a long way and  then when we add our powders it just  softens the whole thing out and it gives  it a much more  cohesive look so now I'm going to go  into the powder and I'm going to be  using a fluffier brush this is the pro  powder brush number 59 just because I  want this to be a loose application and  we're just gonna dust and give me that  little pop again yeah there we go just  gonna dust this right over where we  applied all of our Contour  and this is also going to set it so it  doesn't move while you're out enjoying  your event  [Laughter]  here's where we're getting that neck too  and so the powder is really as you can  see what's sort of softening the whole  effect it's setting that cream and it's  really starting to bring the colors all  together so you get this really  beautiful complexion the same way you do  it on your face really soft really light  but it's definitely starting to enhance  the natural clavicle Bones the  decolletage which is exactly what we  want and let's jump into the next step  which is the highlighting because that's  really where we get the cherry on top  and really brings this whole thing  together okay so I'm going to be using  the new Charlotte Tilbury highlighter  this is a powdered highlighter really  finely milled absolutely beautiful and  I'm going to be applying with the pro  brush number 79 because I want something  a little more tapered and precise  we're gonna pick that product up and  give me a little pop again and that's  exactly what we want this to do is go  right on those high points of the  decolletage of the bone jewelry if you  will and you just dust it right on top  it picks it up so beautifully you're  making me glow you are yes she's  literally glowing it's absolutely  beautiful I also like to take a little  bit onto the shoulders  because it really brings everything  together  gotta get those shoulders glowing and  popping girl what's excess on the brush  I like to take to the top portion of the  decolletage because this is going to  create an overall look that all the skin  from the face to the body is all healthy  and glowing and absolutely polished and  beautiful and that's exactly the end  result and you still get this even when  she's sort of naturally stanced she's  getting that nice accentuation to her  clavicle bone and that's it really  simple really easy there is one final  step though you do need a little bit of  a setting spray I really recommend it it  can be the final thing that makes sure  that your skin looks great all night all  through your whole event and so I'm  gonna be using this one from Sephora  collection this is the makeup setting  spray and all it needs is basically an X  in Mist to set your makeup whether it's  on your face or your decolletage I'm  gonna have you close one second for me  love and we're gonna go boom boom and  that's a great way to set your makeup so  you can rock the night away and have a  great time with your gorgeous bone  jewelry and looking good all right well  I really hope you all enjoyed this and  as you can see it doesn't take a lot of  products or a lot of artistry to really  make sure that you can create a cohesive  look from your complexion on your face  all the way down to your neck and  decolletage that looks absolutely great  and if you want to try any of these  products you can shop the shelf right  now and until next time enjoy your event  party season dance in the night away pop  in your bone jewelry and we'll see you  all soon everyone bye  oh nothing,F,2841,156,9,"Apr 5, 2023"
Sephora,"Why I Made This with Brand Founder Danessa Myricks | Sephora",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqwJ0wcBqkw,[Music]  I started making products in my basement  that quickly led to my Consulting career  but I realized that there were huge gaps  in beauty product offerings  so many people were being ignored from  the beauty conversation I knew I had to  do more and that's why I made this  [Music]  I'm danessa myricks founder of danessa  myrick's beauty  my journey starts in Queens as a young  dreamer growing up wanting to make my  parents proud and do something  extraordinary when I first started doing  makeup I had nobody and I had to be  super resourceful really the only thing  that I could afford was these 99 pencils  and I would use it for eye shadow I  would use it for liner and so I created  color picks which basically does  everything  I'm headed to Hempstead Long Island to  visit my mom in the salon the salon is  where some of my fondest Beauty memories  were born I'm so happy we get this  growing up the way I can  I connect Beauty was through my mom I  wanted to be her the next American  Beauty exists because of you when you  allowed me to start wearing makeup and I  asked you like what should I wear you  would like wear blue I still talk about  it because that's one of the undertone  for dark skin you gotta do something to  you know  give yourself a little life and write  about the pictures I used to paint well  that's what my love for color came from  you don't you know I used to take you to  the museum I know I know my you took me  to a museum and I discovered origami  paper and that literally changed my life  those little beautiful colored Square  pieces of paper or some metallic some  with color like I still think about that  now when I make makeup  a lot of people don't know the Brand's  name originally was I make you beautiful  but I decided that I wanted to name it  danessa myricks because I wanted to have  that full responsibility that this is a  full representation of what I want to  see in the world it represents my entire  family Journey  my makeup Journey started when I was 30  years old prior to entering into Beauty  I was in Corporate America it wasn't  feeding my soul an amazing thing  happened  I got fired I didn't feel safe  but it was important for me to give  everyone that was being omitted a voice  so I was on a mission  [Music]  you know we've been taking the color fix  customer on a journey how can we elevate  it I want to look at the boxes and how  we're going to play with it with these  new caps we can play around with a  different look a different feel I love  the finishes that you have how they're  represented on the box but how do we get  more metallic than metallic I love  creating things that somebody can just  have it in their hands and make it be  what they want it to be the first thing  that I sold were little pots creams and  lots of different colors they performed  they lasted a long time but I wanted it  to do a little bit more and I wanted  something more fluid  the next iteration of color pigs came in  a little tiny pump artists really  Embrace color fix right from the start  but then I started getting the phone  calls danessa the product is not coming  out of the pump and I've learned there's  a lot of mechanics that go behind making  a product last for a long time so with  color picks we started from you know a  little pump but now it's elevated to  this really beautiful squeeze tube  experience the feeling that you get from  these two  squeeze out to you know origami has  always inspired me that's what I loved  about origami it's like it's that  Precision that you get but also the play  and the energy this is a collectible  item so I think leaning into the  collectible item is creating fun new  shades  we went from that one product with 15  skus to now over 450 skus that we sell  and colorfix represents well over 60  percent of the volume that we've done as  a brand over the last 10 years and  beyond that it was the very first  product that we won a best in Beauty  award for can you imagine since then  we've created so many groundbreaking  products but I had the knowledge the  expertise to do it right this time  you know the foils are a big deal for us  especially Milky Way We super soft on  her fully stocked so we're great I  pre-ordered on that one and ordered the  abundance of it so that's why we're good  on that okay perfect it was a great  space for me to be because when Sephora  knocked on the door I was ready  foreign  reached out and said that they wanted  this brand Vanessa Marx Beauty in their  store it was super surreal the beautiful  thing about it is I really did feel like  I belonged there they made me feel like  they knew who I was and knew what I was  offering and that we can work together  as a team to make sure that I just don't  show up in Sephora but that we can  Thrive there  we're breaking records we're setting  standards we really see ourselves as a  Little Engine That Could  seeing what you want to be is so  important there are so many people that  I meet along my journey who really don't  see the possibility for themselves I  want them to know that the world needs  you the world needs your participation  I'm waiting for you do it  [Music],F,3640,301,35,"Apr 3, 2023"

Chanel,"Siri Hustvedt about writing and the idea of success — CHANEL and Literature",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb-bvHNbI5c,"I'm always hesitant about giving advice

to young women.

I moved to New York in 1978.

It was a different city then.

And the idea

of achieving...

success...

is something that was actually
counter to my own ambitions.

When I was young,

what I wanted to try to do

was write something that I thought was...

good, by my own lights.

And that had to suffice

as success.

Now,

I do think that people need...

Especially young women...

encouragement of some kind

to keep writing.

To write in a vacuum
is a very painful thing

for any person.

But for people...

women, people of color,

people who are marginalized

and have been marginalized
in literary culture,

it's harder.

My advice,

I suppose,

would be to...

not accept the definitions of success

that are repeatedly given to us
in this culture.

But over time...

to understand

what that might mean
for you as a writer.

It's been a longstanding cliché

in Western culture

to make the argument

that women are better at emotions

than men.

I think this is actually nonsense.

And it's part of a long tradition

of connecting emotion to the body,

and women,

and intellect to the mind, and men.

It's a binary that I reject.

Also, to be fair
to the history of literature,

there are a great many male writers

who have penned
tender emotional texts,

but they are not reduced to that
tenderness and that emotion.

So I think

we should be very careful

about isolating the writing of women

in a ghetto of emotion.

I've been asked
about the discipline of writing,

getting up every morning,

giving it my six or seven hours,

and what that means.

Of course, it comes from desire.

That if you don't want to do it,

it's a strange thing to do!

And it's a risky business as well.

So it's about desire.

Perverse as it may be,

I have always felt

deeply alive when I'm writing.

Why that is, I can't say.

But I do know that many artists
in many different fields have...

that enlivened sense
when they're working.

If I didn't have that, I wouldn't do it.

The idea that success,

for women, is somehow damaging

and makes you feel bad about yourself
is total crap.

I mean, this is part
of the cultural idea that...

that women should not embrace success,

that there's something unfeminine,

ambitious,

out-for-yourself,

about that position.

And we have to...

I think, oppose this idea.

Is it harder? No! It's not harder!

It's better!

And I don't know

if that question would be posed to a man.

Chanel,Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon Invite Siri Hustvedt — CHANEL and Literature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rlaYCE2hk,"I'm extremely happy to be with you

in New York today

for our tenth
Rendez-Vous Littéraire Rue Cambon.

The first one to be held in the US.

Tonight, we are thrilled
to welcome the writer Siri Hustvedt

and discuss her work
alongside writers Rachel Eliza Griffiths

and Erica Wagner.

Siri, you are the author

of a poetry collection, multiple novels,

and prestigious award-winning essays.

It is difficult,
and you'll understand why...

very difficult to summarize your work
in only a few lines,

so prolific it is,

not to mention
the many subjects, universes

and emotions it spans.

You are passionate about so many topics,

about neuroscience,
psychology, psychoanalysis,

psychiatry, literature,

philosophy, sociology,
anthropology, ethnography,

painting, cinema, poetry, music...
It's like the list is endless!

In your research,
you question the ambivalence

of our relationship to motherhood,

suffering, mental health,

body-shaming in Western culture,

the sexist prejudice that persists

when a woman is in a position of power,

whether it be
in creative or academic fields,

and many other burning topics
agitating our society today.

Thank you so much, Charlotte.

And I am delighted to be here
in my native city of New York

to host this wonderful event with Chanel,

part of the Rendez-Vous Littéraire
Rue Cambon.

Siri is a New Yorker too,

though one who came here from Minnesota
a few years ago now.

No doubt we'll discuss what being
a New Yorker means to her these days.

Her first novel, The Blindfold,
was published in 1992

and set out her stall.

It is a novel with multiple perspectives,

multiple ways of seeing the world,

and Siri has delighted in polyphony
from that day to this.

She is the author now
of seven novels,

including What I Loved,

The Blazing World

and most recently
Memories of the Future.

Her essay collections include

A Woman Looking at Men
Looking at Women

and Mothers, Fathers and Others.

I will add, however, that her memoir,

The Shaking Woman
or a History of My Nerves

is a valuable addition

to the canon of philosophical
and scientific autobiography.

I am also delighted
to introduce Rachel Eliza Griffiths,

Eliza is a poet, a visual artist,

and a novelist.

I'm so excited to read her novel, Promise,

which will be published in July

and which has been described
by Marlon James

as both ""magical"" and ""magnificent.""

So I'm going to start
with a question for you, Siri.

You are such a prolific author
and your work is very various.

You write in so many forms,
on so many subjects.

What are the origins
of this boundless curiosity?

You know, I've often asked myself,

what is the source of human curiosity?

You know, you see it...

in dogs, right?

You let a dog out of the car,
when you take a trip,

and the dog goes and forages
and sniffs everywhere.

I think this is something...

This is a mammalian business, right?

We share this with other creatures.

And what we have, right,
that other creatures don't,

is a reflective self-consciousness,

an ability to see ourselves
as other people...

able to use many,
many different languages.

And that, I think,

creates another form of curiosity,

and dissatisfaction.

So you have to have...

a curiosity,
but then you sniff around

and you're not satisfied.

And that leads you somewhere else,

to another book, or another discipline,

that's taken on the same question
but in a different way.

Fascinating.

Charlotte, what were some of your thoughts

in returning to Siri's work
for this event?

What was it like for you to look
over this body of work, as a whole?

Well, I was so surprised to see

the freedom in which she can go
from one subject to the other,

and combine
so many different perspectives.

And that's a real talent,

to be able to combine

neurosciences and literature

and psychoanalysis, poetry...

and do it in such a natural way.

Also, I was impressed

by her constant attention

to the singularity of each story,

of each situation,

and that capacity to go from
the extremely singular and personal

to something more universal,
and then going back again

to that singular experience.

Eliza, you're an artist who works

in different forms and different media,

and to me, I see a connection
with Siri's work because of that.

So how do you think about Siri's work?

One of the many things
I love about Siri's work

is that she explodes
our expectations of narrative,

and how narratives are made,

and who is narrating stories
about women's lives,

about our psychological selves.

She kind of unpacks history
and memory and sensuality in the body,

always questioning the body,
questioning who is looking at that body,

who is claiming that body.

And I feel her rigor,

her discontent,
as she mentioned in the sniffing...

Her discontent becomes
a rich space for her readers

and for other thinkers and philosophers.

And so...

there's something indomitable
about her spirit,

and there is her generosity.

And I do think that is a rare combination

in a mind and in a life.

So I very much admire that about Siri,
amongst many other things.

I'm not going to be able
to get through this!

You're just going to have
to keep listening to us

saying wonderful things about you.

It's very, very pleasurable
and embarrassing at the same time.

Well, you are going to be able
to hear too, as I said,

some of Siri's work.

For our first reading,

we'll hear a little extract
from her most recent novel,

Memories of the Future.

It is a layered text,

as its protagonist, S.H., looks back

on the time, the late 1970s,

when she moved from Minnesota
to make a life in New York City.

It is a novel, too, about female identity

that speaks to the #MeToo movement
with incisiveness and humor.

Eliza.

""We all suffer and we all die,

""but you, the person
who is reading this book right now,

Thank you so much!

Siri, I mentioned #MeToo

in my little introduction to that extract.

How did the growth of that movement
make you reflect

on your own past,

and how did it affect
the writing of this novel?

It was funny,

because the whole #MeToo business exploded

when I was pretty late
in writing the novel.

So there is,
at the very center of the book,

a sexual assault.

And that had already happened.

And then I thought to myself,

""Finally, you've written a topical book!""

It didn't really turn out that way.
I mean, it was hardly mentioned.

I guess it's because
it's not really conventional,

or it didn't take up the #MeToo movement
in the way that it usually is.

But I think,

seriously,
the most important aspect of that

which is still going on,
I don't think of it as finished,

even though media
often talk about it that way...

That there was a contextual movement,

a shift...

in the social values

around molestation, assault,

grabbing, whistling.

You know,
when I was a young woman...

and this, Memories of the Future,
is essentially a dialog

between an older narrator
and the younger person...

it was just business as usual,

fending off, you know,
aggressive men here and there.

And it never entered one's mind
to report it

unless, you know,
there was real blood and guts

and rape involved.

And I think that shifted.

If a man is massaging your leg
under the table...

That happened
a couple of times to me, long ago.

And...

it is now, I think, acceptable to say,

""If you don't take your hand off my knee,

""in this circle of people,

""I'm going to ask you to get out of here.""

But that wasn't the case.
There was really no social outlet.

I think this is changing
and that's a very good thing.

Now #MeToo, it was often centered

on famous, beautiful actresses with money.

And I would think...
I also worked as a waitress,

you know, in my young days,

to make money,

and restaurants were places of hierarchy

where men would...

you know...

use their power, however small it was...

- Exercise their power?
- Yes.

To make sexual advances
on the underlings.

This is still true,

and I think we have to, you know,
keep talking about these hierarchies,

of gender, race and class,
that are ongoing.

How, Charlotte...

how does this extract speak
to your feelings

about literature

and the possibilities
literature offers us, as readers?

So many possibilities!

First of all, it's the possibility
to transcend time.

And, you know,
just the fact of saying,

the writer's present is in connection
with the reader's present,

although there can be
hundreds of years separating the two...

It seems very banal, but it's incredible.

And just the fact that you stress
the bodily sensations,

thinking of the reader,

how he will be sitting
and feeling sensations...

We realize how that connection

kind of abolishes chronology,

and that's one of the great powers
of literature.

Eliza, as this extract suggests,

the reader is a figure of hope,

because the reader is in the future,

beyond the work of the novelist herself.

I wonder how you feel
about your readers and Siri's,

how you think about readers?

I mean, in our conversation now,

I'm realizing one of the things
that occurs in literature is,

the reader becomes a witness

to the reckoning
that the author is having

in this intimate way,
but also in this kind of public way,

and that the reader is there

to acknowledge the urgency

and immediacy

and embodiment

of that living perspective
as it's happening,

but also to function

as this space of time

to meet the author

in the kind of way
where they're both alive suddenly

and suspended in the past,
present and future,

which are all happening
at the same time

because you travel with the author.

But then you're from the future,

and then they are envisioning themselves
in the future.

And I think that's quite fascinating
and compelling

that there is this intimacy that happens,

even when you return to a text repeatedly,

that you bring
a different offering to yourself.

And that novelist, living or dead,
they're bringing something toward you,

to be recognized between the two of you.

And that reciprocity,
or that invisibility, is quite powerful.

And I think it's always, often powerful,

particularly in Siri's work.

That makes me want to ask,

before we move
to the next extract, Siri...

because it seems to me

we are often, I want to say imprisoned,

in an idea of chronological time.

Every day, we move forward
through our days and events happen.

But I feel that your work recognizes

that that's not necessarily
how we experience time.

Yeah, I mean,

this is a great philosophical question
that has never been answered.

Right? What is time?

There are all these theories in physics

as people know,

that there is no such thing.

There is a space-time, static reality,

which in Memories of the Future,
I compare to a library.

You know, the idea in physics
is that you can go back and nothing...

will be changed, it's very strange.

And to be humble in the face
of temporal reality is important,

but also to understand

that we are continually...

taking from the past, reading.

We have neighbors from,

you know, the ancients,

or from completely other cultures,

and they can become intimate friends
through the drama of reading.

I am sometimes amazed

that other people
aren't amazed by this, right?

So I did want
to acknowledge the reader.

Every book is made
between a text and a reader.

It is an alive business.

It is not dead.

And, you know,
it's important to recognize

the temporal magic of reading.

And it often goes unnoticed.

Our next reading is from The Shaking Woman
or A History of My Nerves,

first published in 2010.

While speaking at a memorial event
for her father,

Siri tells the reader,

she suffered a violent seizure
from the neck down.

In this wonderful,
uncategorizable memoir

the author tracks her condition
and its treatment,

but also its meaning and significance.

""The first time I shook,
I was standing on home ground.

""It wasn't only that my father
had taught for many years at the college.

""As a child, I had lived on that campus

""because my professor father
had a second job

""as head resident of a men's dormitory.

""That old building
has since been torn down,

""but I remember its murky hallways,
its smells,

""the elevator with its red door,

""the soda pop machine
glowing on the floor below us,

""and the button on it
for Royal Crown Cola.

""I remember the fat, kind janitor, Bud,
with his dusty grey pants,

""the forbidden upper floors,

""where my sister Liv and I ventured
a couple of times.

""I remember the view
from the window in our apartment

""where I stood one Easter and cried.

""On that day of hats and gloves
and light spring dresses,

""convention dictated warm and sunny,

""but what I saw through the window
was snow.

""I remember
when I learned to ride a bicycle

""on that same ground one spring,

""and the feeling I had
when my father let go of the bike

""and I pedalled off alone,

""weaving a little, but joyous,
the moment I understood

""I had been released
and was still upright.

""I remember the power plant
where my father took me and Liv

""through the billowing white smoke

""and the blast of heat
and the roar of machinery

""into a small room
near the back of the building

""where a man made ice cream
and gave us samples for free.

""I remember lying over the grates
outside the library

""and studying the candy wrappers
and cigarette butts

""and various kinds of debris
that had fallen down there,

""and how absorbing it was,

""just to look at those things.

""We moved outside town
before I entered the third grade,

""but aside from a few fragments
from my third and fourth years,

""my autobiographical memory
from five through nine

""is largely fixed on that campus.

""Places have power.

""Did standing there
on that familiar ground

""unleash the reality of death for me?

""The presence of an unspeakable 'it'?

""After all, I live in New York,

""and didn't see my father
on a daily basis.

""In New York, it was ordinary
that he should be missing from my life.

""Was I thrown
into a subliminal realization

""that his absence was permanent,
irrevocable,

""without being consciously aware
of the turn taken inside me?

""Did the faces of people I knew
from my childhood

""hurl me back to an earlier self?

""Did the shuddering have something to do
with occupying my father's place,

""quite literally standing in a place
I felt belonged to him?

""Was the sight of that green lawn
outside Old Maine

""where my father once had his office,

""the image of which
is scratched into my memory,

""because I walked there again and again

""not only as a child but as a girl,

""and then as a young woman,
when I was a student?

""But it wasn't the vision of the place
that started the convulsion.

""It was the act of speaking.

""It began with the first word
and ended with the last.

""Was it connected to a memory?”

Thank you so much, Eliza.

What does it mean, Siri,
to make yourself the object

of your own story?

It's called The Shaking Woman
or A History of my Nerves.

So ""the shaking woman""
is the alien third-person object,

and the ""history of my nerves""
acknowledges the fact

- that the shaking woman…
- It's you.

I'm the shaking woman.

And I didn't know it while I was writing,

but the arc of the book
is from the third-person feeling

of being possessed by an alien power,

to recognizing
that I am the shaking woman.

That's the last moment.

I did not know I was going to write that.

Did you know the title at the outset?

Yes, I think I had the title

and I knew

that it was going to be
an open-ended investigation.

But I did some writing...

in the process.

So I would write after I had seen

a specialist of some kind

and record it.

Which was...

You know, there are
real funny parts in this book,

and I think that combination

of the intimate and the personal

and withdrawing quite far away
and talking about the nature of memory,

telling neurological stories...

was a kind of freedom.

Writing the book, I think,
actually had a therapeutic value

that I didn't know about
while I was writing it.

- How interesting.
- Yeah.

Because the very...

telling of it,

not only as a personal story,

not only as...

You know, ""Could this be about my father?
What happened to me? What was going on?""

but through
many other possible explanations

taken from different disciplines...

I thought of it as a funnel

that you keep turning
around the same problem.

And the fact
that I had already been,

you know, studying neuroscience
and psychiatry,

and had many friends in those fields,

none of whom could...

diagnose this problem...

Then I heard, after I finished the book,
from many people who wrote to me

who had shaking disorders
of one kind or another,

that were undiagnosed,

and it turns out there is a whole world...

of shaking out there

without a name.

We're getting into the final reading,

which is from the essay
""What Does a Man Want?""

Such a good question!

In Siri's collection of essays,

Mothers, Fathers and Others,
published in 2021.

In it, she raises the issues

of the origins and implications
of misogyny,

woman-hating by another name,

and draws attention
to the ongoing destructive power

of a patriarchal society.

""The irrational demand that fuels misogyny

""is like the double image found on a coin.

""On one side is the perfect,
caring, sacrificing,

""loving, natural mother,

""a being who does not,
and has never existed.

""Flip her over and you find her evil twin,

""the rejecting, selfish,
unnatural mother who seeks power.

""The irony is that mothers
are already powerful,

""not always, but most often,
the source of food and succour in infancy.

""The fact that there are men who mother

""has had little effect on the idea
that mothering is female.

""The idea remains stubborn.

""The absence of mothering of one kind
or another means peril,

""and that scary,
potentially abandoning mother

""must be punished.

""She is the source
of male and female moral outrage.

""Human beings, all human beings,

""are caring and rejecting, kind and cruel,

""generous and selfish,
admittedly to varying degrees.

""But ambivalence is a feature
of much of our intimate emotional lives.

""A woman doesn't have
to be a mother to be punished.

""In fact, being childless
can be a synonym for selfish.

""All women are expected
to act on this cultural imperative,

""the absurd demand that I, the woman,

""exist only for you,
the eternal man-child,

""to soothe, placate, feed, hold,

""admire and adore you.

""And if I do not perform this part
to your full satisfaction

""I am a spoiled, wicked, heartless bitch.

""A witch.

""The oaths and punches and kicks
that come my way are well deserved.

""When my niece was three,
she said to my sister, her mother,

""'You know what's funny, Mom?'

""'No,' said my sister.

""'Sometimes I love you so, so much.

""'And other times, I hate you.'

""All intimate relations
are complex mixtures of emotion,

""of love and hate,

""but patriarchal structures in the West
have enforced

""a prolonged, infantile fantasy
in many men,

""especially those at the top of the heap

""or those at the top
of their particular heap,

""that women, like the mythical Eve,
were made for them.

""The idea that they were once
inside a woman

""and that a woman's body
was instrumental in making them

""has to be suppressed

""in mythical cultural ideas

""which bleed into what is supposed
to be stripped of all myth:

""parts of science.

""And if male heterosexual desire for women
enters the picture,

""the need to embrace the mixed angel-demon

""creates a poisonous emotional stew.

""When gender, subversion, racism, class

""or other factors
are added to the patriarchal stew,

""it becomes all the more deadly,

""and the people we call women,
a diverse lot, to be sure,

""may also become ingredients
in the concoction

""to protect themselves from punishment,

""to align themselves with men,

""or their status on the societal ladder.

""'Don't rock the boat,
stand by your man...'

""or to placate themselves with a delusion

""that they are by nature
kinder, gentler, sweeter beings.""

Thank you!

I'm going to start with you, Charlotte,

because I know
this passage from Siri's work

spoke to you particularly.

How does it fit
into your thinking about misogyny

and specifically about the way
the mother and the mothering body

is viewed in wider society?

I just loved the title of the essay,
""What Does a Man Want?""

I just, you know, immediately

was very excited to read it,

We talk a lot about...

you know, misogyny,

but in a way,
it's always underestimated somehow.

It's so widely spread

and it concerns every culture,
every continent,

every social condition.

But what's interesting
in that passage is,

we think that misogyny is within
a system of values, of ideas,

that if we deconstruct that,

then, you know,
we can rebuild a more equal society.

But we come back
to the body-mind connection,

because the simple fact
that no one reflects

on that idea that we all come,

no matter what is
our relationship with our mother,

if we've been abandoned or not, if we had
a loving mother or an uncaring mother,

we all came to this world

because a female body accepted us,

or somehow we had to go through that.

What is your best hope, Siri,

for pulling ourselves
out of that patriarchal stew?

I'm very interested in this
because I think it's important

to address gestation and birth,

the reproductive body,

how this is involved

in what we think of as misogyny,

how the body itself is identified

with feminine and female processes

and the mind, the intellect
is identified with masculinity.

This is an old business.

In the symposium, Plato taught,

""Everybody's pregnant,
but there's two kinds of pregnancy:

""the natural pregnancy of the female,

""and then there's
the male philosopher's birth of ideas.

""And that is superior.""

We are still trading

on the pregnancy of the symposium

and we have to, I think, talk about it.

There is a fear, often,
of speaking about biological processes

and gestation,

because...

it's identifying...

you know, let's say that sometimes
feminists can be nervous

about talking about that, because biology
has been an enemy of feminism.

Women are reduced
to their reproductive capacities.

But something moving and fluid

that goes on until we die,
and frankly, even afterwards,

because there are processes
of decay that are active.

Scramble the damn categories!

I really think we have to do that.

And if you question them,

over and over again,
not in some feeble way...

I mean, you see this
in media all the time.

You know, ""We hate binaries,""

or whatever it is.

No, let's think through and keep talking

about what these categorical divisions
that we make mean.

Eliza, I believe you wrote
your first novel, Promise,

in part as a tribute
to your late mother.

You have said that it is
""a love letter to my mother

""and the motherless ache
I sensed in myself.""

Can you talk a little bit about
what the idea of the mother means to you?

Yes. I mean, I think,
at the language level,

I had to empty out the word
""mother"" in a way.

And what did it mean to be ""unmothered,""

to carry the memories
I had of my mother after her death,

and to think about
the real complicated energy

when she was alive

and the ways that,
you know, coming up...

I'm thinking of coming up
as a writer in New York...

of the different women in my life,

and how we would mother ourselves

or how we would kind of detach the habits

and routines and disciplines
of our mothers

and claim a different kind of territory
for ourselves.

And so, you know, ""mother"" will always be

this very primal, universal word,

and yet, we have to breathe

a new…

- A kind of new energy into it.
- I agree.

A new...

you know, space for it to really live

and in the space of thinking about,

you know,
this feeling of motherlessness,

it also means,
what are daughters and sons?

What are the men?
What are mothers and mothers?

What are mothers and wives?

So then all of this becomes
very shaky terrain

and I found, for myself,
working on a novel...

when you're young,
how much you rely on the mother.

How much you rely on the father,
but really the mother's body.

And as I'm getting older,

the places I meet my mother
is in my own body, oftentime.

I don't have children,
but I meet my mother,

and I have relationships where I see,

""Oh, I'm the maternal person…
Oh, my God...

""in the dynamic.""

I also want to say, you know,
I am now my own father too,

because I want to bring
those energies together.

So if I am misogynistic toward myself,

where did I learn that from?

And now I'm bringing that
toward my feminine energy.

- Speaking of mothers and daughters...
- Yes!

As it happens, we are going to welcome
now another artist to the stage

to sing for us.

Please join us, Sophie Auster,

who is going to sing, Hey Girlfriend.

Hey.

Hey girlfriend, where'd you go?

Remember all the things
you used to know about me

Used to know about me

Heard you got married, too

It's just like you
not to mention the day

I hope you got swept away

Hey girlfriend, is it really the end?

Remember that time we made amends?

We wrote our names in the sidewalk

In the rain

It's you and me forever

Forever or never

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

Hey girlfriend, I never knew

You want to do all the things
I've aspired to

There's room enough for two

Hey girlfriend, come around

Rock solid, steady
With my feet back on the ground

My feet are on the ground

Hey girlfriend, I've been feeling ashamed

You walked away without a thing to say

And you only go when you're falling down

And you lose your crown

You said forever

Forever or never

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

And yes, it is true

That I'm fine without you

But every now and then
I get a little bit lost

Without you

You said forever

Forever or never

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

Blame me for your blackout nights

I was there to make it right

Forever

You said forever

You said forever

You said forever

You said forever

Please, join us.

Thank you so much, Sophie!

And I'd love the two of you
to talk briefly

about what that song means to you

and how you think about it, together.

So Hey, Girlfriend was written
about an old friend of mine that...

We grew up together,
we did everything together.

It was the so-called ""BFF.""

And, you know,
we drifted apart as we got older.

And it was one
of those relationships that

I kind of held onto
for a really long time.

I wanted that relationship,

and then I realized
that it was really over.

And I feel like culturally,
we don't talk enough

about how heartbreaking it is to lose...

a really close friend
of the same sex.

It's platonic, it's not sexual,

but it's something
that is really, really deep.

And so I wanted to write
about that kind of...

how painful losing a friend
like that can be.

Yes, you know, there's a shyness
about passionate relations

between women, among women,

and it wasn't always the case.

You know, in the 19th century,

the idea of girls having crushes

on one another,

whether they were...

There's an erotic component
to all, I think,

human relations of any interest.

But these, again, categorical divisions

have made,
you know, heterosexual love affairs

the big topic.

And the other relations we have,

for example, with our parents,

or with people of the same sex,

love relations,

in the 20th century and into the 21st,

have been ignored.

Thank you, Siri.

We have a few closing questions for you

before we open up to our audience.

Selfishly, perhaps,
since we're here in New York,

where you live and where I grew up,

I want to ask you
about the meaning of the city for you.

There's a wonderful passage that I love,

the opening of Memories of the Future,

where your protagonist, S.H., finds refuge

in the New York Public Library
on 42nd Street,

in its grand reading room, fit for kings.

It's a place that's of the city
and outside the city all at once.

It's so beautifully described.

What does New York mean to you?

Well, you know, the New York
that I moved to in 1978

and the New York
that we're sitting in now,

they're not the same place.

I was a graduate student at Columbia,

and that neighborhood
was completely different.

Part of Memories of the Future
is describing these two realities,

the bourgeois current reality

versus the city that had
just been through a financial crisis

and was crumbling,

and much more dangerous than it is now.

And I wanted to avoid nostalgia.

What it seems to me
is always true of New York,

is that it's always changing.

It's more like an organic...

creature,
than a city like Paris, that I love.

But it does not stand still.

Neighborhoods are always going up or down,

usually up these days.

In various parts, frantically up!

But that...

chaotic reality...

is exciting.

It was exciting then
and it's exciting now.

We always ask our esteemed guest,

what advice would you give

to a young artist
starting on her creative journey?

Right!

Yeah, I said this earlier today,

but when I was 15, my mother
gave me the most beautiful advice,

and I keep thinking about it.

She said, ""Don't do anything
you don't really want to do.""

And I think for every artist,

this is very good advice.

I think about it a lot.

Is this what I really want to do?

And don't do anything
that I don't really want to do.

I think this is good advice
for any human being,

but for artists in particular,
it has resonance

because you don't want to betray

the emotional truth
that will make your work

something of value.

Thank you, Siri.

I'm here in Cannes as a jury member.

The Cannes Film Festival, to me,
has always been

a shining light of international film.

It has always held the standard
of what cinema can be,

how it can change our mind,
how it can push things forward.

It's the biggest red carpet,

on the largest international stage
that I'm aware of.

And I got to have this moment
that I'll never forget

of linking hands.

Ruben said:
""We will not let go of each other,

""we will interlock our fingers and walk.""

Looking to either side
and seeing these people with me...

We're all from very different backgrounds,
have lived different lives

and we're coming together,
watching the same films together

and having deep, long discussions,
which is one of my favorite things to do.

Cinema has continued to be the thing
that has made me feel less alone.

Cinema and CHANEL:
they're so forever intertwined.

The way it flows, the way it moves,

it's just naturally cinematic.

The fashion is so inspiring

and so important to humans
for expressing themselves.

It's the beginning of a conversation,
the way we say hello.

And I have the luxury
of getting to move between worlds.

I get to try different things on
and play different characters.

I do that with clothes, too.

That's part of what has excited me so much
with my life, on my own journey:

being on the red carpet of exploring
what it feels like to be in my own skin.

Chanel,"In conversation with Lubna Playoust — Cannes 2023 — CHANEL and Cinema",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB7tszaYtNE,"""Room 999"" picks up the question
Wim Wenders asked in 1982

to 16 directors, in Cannes.

I wanted to recreate the same setting
with other directors,

because it was
a very premonitory film

and I wondered
what the answers would be today.

Cinema, cinema.

In 1982,
Wim Wenders asked the question,

""Is cinema a language about to disappear,
a dying art?""

I find the question very topical.

""Room 999""
is a tribute to ""Room 666"".

I like this twist on the title.

It's interesting

because the diversity of answers
mirrors the diversity one finds in cinema.

Every director, every filmmaker
sheds a different light.

The directors
answer the question, of course,

but their answer also reveals
their personality.

What is interesting too
is the evolution:

only 2 women
answered the question in 1982.

Today, they are 11.

We are not talking about the death
of cinema, but about its definition.

What is cinema?

Godard said:
""I don't make movies, I make cinema.""

This is the mystery:

what is the difference
between movies and cinema?

As a young filmmaker,
how do you address the question of time?

It's just being able to accept
to cut out a scene, even if you like it.

What will become of cinema
if we no longer seize time?

You said you shot with several cameras,
you create a moment of chaos

to have the material
to make your film afterwards.

That's the way you are.

There is still room
to develop cinema.

The house of CHANEL
is also interested in supporting projects

reflecting on cinema,

like ""Room 999"".

It's important to understand
that this kind of project

is vulnerable and needs support.

You're an amazing director.
How did you get there?

I didn't want to direct,
but everyone pushed,

and I said no, I'm a screenwriter,
I love words.

But I felt ready.

Making a film isn't easy,
you have to bear the weight of it,

carry a team, a desire, a passion.

Having co-written with top filmmakers,

I deepened my vision of the world
and discovered myself as a woman.

I wanted to put this across
so I went for it.

I want all women, not just Africans,
to see themselves in Banel.

As a woman,
you're both French and Senegalese.

You're at Cannes for the first time.
That sends a strong message.

CHANEL is appreciative
of young filmmakers and actors.

CHANEL is daring,

and wearing CHANEL

in a suit designed just for Dakar,
was magical,

because you feel stronger in CHANEL.

of a great adventure.

Jeanne du Barry became a dream
17 years ago,

so it's great to celebrate the end
of this obsession.

I discovered Jeanne du Barry's life
in a book.

I immediately loved it.

She was free,
but she wanted to be accepted

by the bourgeoisie, by intellectuals.

She was paradoxical.

The desire to talk about Jeanne
and her issues,

by which I mean
her feeling of being illegitimate

and of betraying her origins,

are questions
that have always tormented me,

and I started thinking I should do something
around her weaknesses.

I was very demanding on the costumes.

I wanted the costumiers to be free,

to seek inspiration in the 18th century,
but on a different path.

On the colors, the lines...

Costumes can say so many things.

We stayed close to Jeanne's style,

with very refined, simple dresses,

in white and ecru.

It was a blend of my vision and
Virginie Viard's with Jürgen's experience.

Before officially starting work
on the film,

I did years of research
and moodboards,

as if it were a rehearsal
of the entire film

in every artistic field.

Very often,

I took photos of clothes
without realizing they were CHANEL.

It was a pleasure to come here
with the dressmaker

and see the dress gradually emerge.

It was very moving.

For Jeanne's personality,

I did a lot of research,

but there's also part of my imagination
and the ideas I formed about her.

I didn't want a documentary,
I don't claim to tell the truth.

I wanted a story that took place
to show beautiful things.

Chanel,"Literary Rendezvous at Rue Cambon: Portrait of Ingeborg Bachmann — CHANEL and Literature",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fARFkSSwE04,"She believes in experience,
in the body...

She believes in casting doubt
on the concept.

It's my pleasure to welcome you today

to a ""Literary Rendezvous""
dedicated to an historic literary figure,

Ingeborg Bachmann,

and to be joined here
by actress Vicky Krieps

and the writer Cécile Ladjali.

Vicky, as an actress, you recently played
the role of Ingeborg Bachmann

in the film by Margarethe von Trotta,

""Journey into the Desert"",

loosely based
on the final years of Ingeborg Bachmann

and her relationship
with the writer Max Frisch.

Cécile Ladjali, you're a writer
and professor of literature.

In 2009 you wrote ""Ordalie,""

a novel loosely inspired
by the love affair

between Ingeborg Bachmann
and poet Paul Celan.

You also wrote a postscript
to the works of Ingeborg Bachmann

for Actes Sud, with whom
you also published your new novel,

""Night Is My Favourite Day.""

Before we start our discussion,

let me take a few moments
to tell you all about this woman.

The writer Thomas Bernhard
described her as,

""the most intelligent
and important poet

""that Austria has brought to the world
this century.""

But her peers weren't just intrigued by
her writing and her radical creativity.

They were also fascinated
by her turbulent personal life.

Her tragic end in Rome,
where she died from burns in 1973,

only added to the air of mystery
that surrounded Bachmann,

a woman who showed such strength
in her writing and opinions,

yet such vulnerability in her love life,
which was filled with passion and sadness.

She was born in 1926 in Klagenfurt,

near the border where Austria
met Yugoslavia and Italy,

into a deeply nationalist family.

Her father joined the Nazi party
in the 1930s

but she chose to resist fascism
under occupation,

with literature as her only ally.

The collision of these two situations

fuelled a deep-seated inner conflict

that haunted her and inspired her work
for the rest of her life.

When she arrived in Vienna in 1946,

she met the writers
of the famous Group 47

and joined them in their belief

that a new form of literature
must be created.

This movement was born from a sense
of philosophical and existential doubt:

How to continue
writing and speaking German,

when their own language
had been taken away,

used in service of the machinery
of propaganda and death.

For her, there could be no new world
without a new language.

Her meeting with the poet Paul Celan

only increased the great sense
of responsibility that she felt,

and her deep conviction that poetry
can be a weapon against barbarism.

In 1952, she was awarded
the highly prestigious Group 47 prize

for her collection, ""Borrowed Time.""

Her poetry was dazzling,
stark, incandescent

and intensely emotional.

During this time, she even made
the front cover of ""Der Spiegel.""

In 1956 she wrote a play
for Bavarian radio,

""The Good God of Manhattan,""

which, little did she know,
would change the course of her life.

The Swiss-German writer Max Frisch
heard her play on the radio

and wrote to her in admiration.

They embarked on
a harrowing five-year relationship,

filled with break-ups and reconciliations.

The last years of her life
were spent in solitude,

and her long-awaited novel ""Malina""

was poorly received by critics.

She died aged 47, leaving behind
thousands of unfinished pages.

Ingeborg Bachmann
lived a life of excess

until her passion
ultimately destroyed her.

For her, writing was nothing less

than a gesture of love,

an urge through which
we search for the right words

to connect to other people.

So...

Thank you Charlotte,
for that wonderful reading.

Vicky, you're going to read a poem

that Ingeborg Bachmann wrote,
and which appeared

in ""Invocation of the Great Bear,""
published in 1956.

Let's hear it.

""What's True.""

""What's true
does not throw sand into your eyes.

""What's true is that sleep and death
seek confirmation from you

""as if anchored in your flesh,
through every pain's advice.

""What's true, from your tomb,
will remove the stone.

""What's true is so sunken in,
so undefined,

""in a seed or leaf,
and in lazy tongues embedded

""for a year, another year,

""then for all time -

""What's true does not buy time,
it cancels it.

""What's true can part the earth,

""like a comb that rakes away dreams,
commands, and laurel crowns,

""till, full of plucked fruit,
its proud and swollen comb

""can set its teeth in you
and strike you down.

""What's true
does not occur until the raid,

""that forces you to give your all.

""Your open wounds make clear
that you're the prey;

""though nothing conquers you
that isn't a betrayal.

""The moon is rising,
and mugs full of regret.

""So drink your fill.

""The night slides down so bitter.

""The dove's own feathers
will be covered by the dregs

""if not a single branch is made secure.

""You still cling to the world,
burdened by chains,

""and yet what's true
still causes the wall to split.

""You wake in darkness,
note everything is the same,

""aware there still exists
an unknown exit.""

Thank you so much, Vicky.

When did you first discover
Ingeborg Bachmann?

When was the first time
you encountered this poem?

At school.

I've always been very fond of poetry.

Because my home was very noisy

and poetry gave me an answer
that was a little more peaceful,

to the questions I had
about human beings.

But yes,
it was just her poetry at first.

I knew her poems

and some of her novels,
but not all of them.

It was only when I made the film
that I discovered

this whole world,
of everything she had written.

She wrote so much.

It turned out this woman was very...

hardworking.

She worked a lot,
and wrote about a lot of things.

So, on Margarethe von Trotta's
film, ""Journey into the Desert""

which you shot,
you read a lot of Bachmann.

What touched you about her work?

Was there something about it
that moved you?

Yes, it was really
the way that she uses words.

She was very aware
that every single word can be...

both an end and a beginning.

It can bring...

both salvation and destruction,

oblivion, and also paradise.

So every word carries
that responsibility.

So how should you talk,

when you know that everything you say

could mean both the end of everything,

and the beginning?

Or, hope and despair?

That's what struck me,
or moved me, the most.

Because it's so true,
and yet we never think about it.

Charlotte, in this poem, ""What is True,""

what did you...

What do you make of this poem
and its relationship to truth?

Well, this poem, with its repetition of
""What is true, what is true...""

There's a link between bravery and truth.

That is, it's not enough
to be brave just once.

We must continue to be brave,
over and over again.

And in a way...

the truth has nothing to do
with intelligence,

or logical processes or concepts.

No. For her, truth is not
the opposite of error.

It's the opposite of cowardice
and hypocrisy,

of our tendency to accept things
that are comfortable for us,

that allow us

to impose order on reality
so we can reassure ourselves.

Truth, for her...

She believes in experience,
in the body,

she believes in casting doubt
on the concept.

There's that line,

that stuck with me:

""What's true
still causes the wall to split.""

It's a powerful image.

Truth is about creating cracks
and fissures,

about fracturing any
comfortable certainties that we may have.

She looks for cracks in language, too,

in the ambiguity of words,

and that's what is...

so powerful about this poem.

She uses very physical, concrete imagery.

Cécile Ladjali, you've written
about Ingeborg Bachmann

in a postscript
to her Actes Sud collection,

and you mention
a speech she made,

entitled: ""Truth Is Within Human Reach"".

Why do you think
she was so obsessively driven

to seek the truth, in your view?

Because she was absolutely certain

that she was born out of evil,

and that, after Auschwitz,
everything had to be reinvented.

She was struck by an aporia...

Not even an aporia,
but a nihilistic statement

that Theodor Adorno,

the philosopher of language,
made in 1949.

He said,
""To write poetry after Auschwitz

""is barbaric.""

That may sound extreme
or hard to grasp,

but he meant that seeking beauty
and harmony

in poetry, or any art,
music, painting, literature,

was disgusting,

because the goal of art,
ever since the dawn of time,

was to achieve beauty.

And in the mid-20th century,

there was the great Enlightenment dream,
the Aufkärung,

this belief that, the more time passed,

the more humane, kind and happy
mankind would become,

because they would grow wiser

thanks to all the books and poems
being created.

Well, the mid-20th century blew
that dream clean out of the water.

Because here was the most ""civilised""
country in the world,

the country of Kant,
Goethe, Schelling, Hölderlin,

perpetrating
the most hideous barbaric acts.

So people turned sceptical.

They stopped believing
in words and literature,

and wondered if silence might
sometimes be preferable.

She knew this was her heritage,
that it was rooted in language,

the language of Germany,
of her family, of love,

but also of Adolf Hitler.

And yet, she took out
her literary shovel,

and dug the foundations of hope
along with her friends in Group 47

and with her lover.

Personally, I prefer Paul Celan,

a Romanian Jew
who escaped the Holocaust,

with whom she fell deeply in love
in the late 1940s.

It was a difficult relationship...

But Ingeborg Bachmann
worked with language,

and she reconciled opposites,
forced the impossible into existence:

the daughter of a Nazi,
head-over-heels in love

with a Jew who escaped the Holocaust.

And,

in the end, the poem
that Vicky just read to us

has a kind of alchemy,
a very Celanian quality.

It's a lot like Celan's work, because
the two of them fed off each other.

You both said, Charlotte and Vicky,

that her creativity
was not at all intellectual.

She was incredibly knowledgeable,

but also very visceral
and physical.

That's especially clear in her poems,

because poetry is an art
that uses music,

rhythm, imagery...

What Vicky just read us
isn't calculated,

but intuitive, deeply felt,

and very... very human.

It's wonderful.

That's Bachmann's truth:
she put down her books

and put her faith in language,

and pulled her words
out of the darkness.

You've written a wonderful novel

that explores the love affair
of Ingeborg Bachmann and Paul Celan,

called ""Ordalie.""

And this novel offers us a glimpse...

from the perspective of a cousin
who is in love with her,

a glimpse into her life.

Was there a particular side
of her character

that you wanted to reveal
in this book?

She was cursed by hope.

She believed in it,
and she believed

in the power of literature.

She was deeply affected by
the Nazis' arrival in Klagenfurt in 1938.

She was in shock,

and she said it was the sun,
and books,

and Rilke, and Baudelaire,
who she was reading at the time,

that saved her from the horror.

She truly believed in it.

And not only did she put
all her faith in words,

and in books, to create a new future,

she also put her faith in love
and in people coming together.

For her, writing was a way
to connect with others.

She didn't write a single poem
that wasn't out of love.

Every poem,
every novel that she wrote,

they were all intended...

Sorry, this is my obsession...
intended for Paul Celan.

The two of them wrote for each other,
back and forth, from book to book.

That's absolutely fabulous.

We can also see this
in ""Correspondence,""

published by Seuil.

In French, its title is
""Le Temps du Coeur.""

And they are clearly...

They were apart,
because Celan was married,

so it was an illicit affair.

But she wrote a book for him,

to console herself.

For Bachmann,
literature was a kind of solace.

Ingeborg Bachmann had
a very strong connection

to others, to the world around her,

and one of her favourite themes
was passionate love.

In her novels,
and especially in ""Malina,""

her great novel,

she describes relationships
within couples

and the difficulties with them
during the 1950s and '60s.

She's not the first person
to write about that.

It could be domination,

or even violence, that played
a role within the relationship.

But why is it that,
of all the women writers at that time...

she writes about it
in this particular way?

What tone does Ingeborg Bachmann use
to talk about relationships?

She's not necessarily following
the typical male-female dialectic,

which can't help
but lead to conflict.

She wants to erase gender.

She's more about...

the sublime poetry...
and I've been obsessed with this...

of androgyny.

In German, you can use the neuter.

Vicky will be able to speak to that
infinitely better than me.

And in the relationship

between Ivan, the hero of ""Malina""
and me, ""Ich,""

eventually a kind of fusion occurs,

where ""Ich"" becomes Ivan
and Ivan becomes ""me.""

There's a kind of porousness,

an erasure of the boundaries of gender

between male and female.

It's nothing less than a proposal
that she's putting to us,

to build a dialogue, and an authentic
connection with other people.

And this erasure of gender,

from a poetic standpoint,
it appears throughout her work.

She was a polygraphic genius.

She wrote in every genre,

from theatre and radio plays,

to novels, poetry, essays...

They were all a vessel for her ideas.

Bachmann was a creative whirlwind.
She worked like a trooper.

So much so
that it frightened her friends.

Cécile, you say
in one of the pieces

that you wrote, that she was
a prisoner of her own femininity.

What exactly do you mean by that?

As we were saying earlier,

she was this little angel
who was only supposed to write poems,

which is idiotic, because poetry is
the most powerful form of literature.

With a novel,
you can bluff for a while,

and be a little mediocre in places.

Poetry must be good from start to finish
and there's no room for error.

Vicky, you acted in the film
by Margarethe von Trotta,

which tells the story of the love affair
that Ingeborg Bachmann had

with the German-speaking writer
Max Frisch.

How did you approach the role?

The way I always do, but this time
it was even more important.

I tried to resist the urge
to turn myself into her,

to resist the urge...

to imitate a person who really existed,

especially a major figure
in German literature

who was not only famous,
but famed for her ideas,

for her intelligence,
for all sorts of things,

and for her physicality.

She had a particular way of speaking.

So I thought,
I'm not going to spend hours

attempting to copy her walk
and her way of speaking,

but instead, I'll try to find
my own personal way

to understand, or to unlock

what made her the way that she was.

And what I found was,

firstly, she was always seeking truth.

And also, the power of words.

When you're aware
that every word you say

can mean anything...

You can't speak at all.

I built it all up from there,

and then tried to forget
what I had built,

forget what I thought I knew.

So I was very...

unsteady, during the shoot.

As if the earth was
constantly shifting underneath me.

Vicky, can you please read
a poem by Ingeborg Bachmann

called ""Bohemia Lies By The Sea.""

It's one of her most famous poems,
it sums up her thinking,

and it's in German.

""Bohemia Lies By The Sea.""

""If houses here are green,
I'll step inside a house.

""If bridges here are sound,
I'll walk on solid ground.

""If love's labour's lost in every age,

""I'd gladly lose it here.

""If it's not me,
it's one who is as good as me.

""If a word here borders on me,
I'll let it border.

""If Bohemia still lies by the sea,
I'll believe in the sea again.

""And believing in the sea,
thus I can hope for land.

""If it's me, then it's anyone,
for he's as worthy as me.

""I want nothing more for myself.
I want to go under.

""Under - that means the sea,

""there I'll find Bohemia again.

""From my grave, I wake in peace.

""From deep down, I know now.

""And I'm not lost.

""Come here, all you Bohemians, seafarers,

""dock whores, and ships unanchored.

""Don't you want to be Bohemians,

""all you Illyrians,
Veronese and Venetians?

""Play the comedies
that make us laugh

""until we cry.

""And err a hundred times, as I erred
and never withstood the trials,

""though I did withstand them
time after time.

""As Bohemia withstood them
and one fine day

""was released to the sea
and now lies by water.

""I still border on a word
and on another land,

""I border, like little else,
on everything more and more,

""a Bohemian, a wandering minstrel,
who has nothing, is held by nothing,

""gifted only at seeing,
by a doubtful sea,

""the land of my choice.""

It's actually quite frustrating,

because I know
that I can't get across

what she wrote in German.

It's full of things
that are un-translatable.

For example, she says ""zugrund.""

She says, ""zugrunde gehen,""

and the ""grund"" is the bottom,

the ""Meeresgrund...""

is the bottom of the ocean.

""To go to the bottom.""

But ""zugrunde gehen,""
when something goes ""zugrunde,""

it's fainting,
or falling apart, or dying.

So, dying, or...

falling apart, that's ""zugrunde,""
but it's also ""the bottom.""

Often, in German,

poems will use certain words,

and that word also means
another word.

But in saying the other word,

those two words tell a story
in the space of one word.

So it's almost impossible to translate.

- An impossible task.
- But a lovely translation.

That ambiguity
is a part of poetry in general.

It's a literary device where a word has
two, even three meanings.

It also shows her androgynous side.

She compares herself to ""un"" Bohemian.

Yes, but it's her.

It's her.
She's become a male Bohemian.

Poets have the ability
to shift boundaries in that way.

Rimbaud does it
in ""The Drunken Boat,""

moving the land,
creating seismic shifts,

and she puts Bohemia
beside the sea.

So, Charlotte, this poem treats...

a fiction as truth.

She says Bohemia is by the sea,
when it's not, at all.

Any thoughts on that?

There's a utopian, dream-like quality,

that I think is very important.

She's in this space

in-between dreams and suffering.

What's more,
hearing the poem in German

was so powerful.

It had this...

fragile quality,
and a voice that admits its fragility.

- That's what is...
- And destruction.

A word can destroy
but it can also save.

Sometimes,
the words she uses are like...

- A blade?
- Yes, like a blade.

But also like a leaf!

There's that sense of falling.

She gets ""to the bottom,""
to the bottom of things,

but what's so powerful is,

something always brings her back.

There's that lovely line
from her collection:

""Everyone who falls has wings.""

She's shifting borders,
putting Bohemia by the sea,

at a time when Germany...
was divided by a wall.

That supreme irony shows
what a great poet she is.

That's what words can do.

But are they enough?
That's Bachmann's dilemma.

But she's betting on it,
almost like Pascal's wager.

There's nothing to lose.

Yes, she's looking for vertigo...

everywhere.

She has that beautiful line:

""I stand radiant
on the brink of the deepest abysses.""

That's the same idea.

Exactly.

She's still staying

on the side of the light, always.

She wrote a poem
called ""Profession of Faith""

where she declares this to the world
at a very young age.

She says, in a way,
that she has a responsibility

to stand and confront the abyss,
as long as she lives.

Thank you.

Thanks to Cécile,

Chanel,Kristen Stewart & Golshifteh Farahani in Berlin — CHANEL and cinema,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxrTRF0N9E,"It's an enormous opportunity
to have a hand

in highlighting beautiful things.

That was an opportunity
that I couldn't say no to.

What do you feel, being the president?

The president doesn't have to be
the most knowledgeable.

The president
should be here to learn.

You know, to be like, my opinion,
my tastes, my bias doesn't matter.

But to kind of bounce off
the different bodies and experiences

that are on the jury
and make sure we're all moving as one.

Some mystic texts say the ocean
is always sitting at the bottom.

And all the rivers come and pour
into that ocean.

From the beginning,
you said, I'm here with you.

And I think that brought this space

and collective consciousness
through to the jury.

And this is actually very rare.

The best thing about it

is that when I'm sitting with you
discussing movies

and talking about what I think,
there is no nationality in there.

We were just talking as artists.

I've always felt really free

and encouraged by the people
actually making the clothes.

And for me,
it's been Karl and Virginie.

And they love movies and they love art
more than anyone I can imagine.

Their intention is available
and it's organic, it's really real

and natural,
honest and beautiful.

Imagine if I called you up and said,
Hey, let's pick 15 movies

and hang out for 2 weeks
and talk about them.

We'd be different people at the end of it.

What's always so striking
is the weight of everything,

then the delicacy
of something underneath.

I walked round the atelier yesterday,

guiltily, when they were
in the final hours of making it.

I felt so intrusive,
but it was unbelievable seeing it up close,

seeing the intricacy
that goes into each piece,

hand-stitched together.

It was really remarkable

and moving to see how much care
and consideration goes into every detail.

Can I touch this?

Beautiful.

I liked the white dresses.

I can't decide which one,
I think the one with the long coat

The accessories were really...
The top hat.

- The bow ties...
- Really fun.

And then the gowns at the end.

So gorgeous.

It was beautiful.
