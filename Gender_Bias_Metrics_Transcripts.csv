of shaving beards need regular

maintenance to look good this video will

show you how to trim and shape your

facial hair

John's beard is full and natural-looking

his goal is to control growth maintain

shape and remove split ends so his beard

stays healthy first start with the right

tools a comb scissors and a beard

trimmer trim your facial hair after a

warm shower so it's easier to manage

begin by combing your facial hair to

remove tangles and inspect length start

under the jawline where most of the

growth is comb against the growth

pattern to identify stray hairs use

shears to trim any hairs outside of your

desired shape occasionally restyle your

beard to check its shape and ensure you

aren't cutting too much off next move to

your sideburns and beard the goal is to

make sure your sideburns and beard are

connected and blend seamlessly comb the

sideburns out use clippers with a high

guard number and gradually work your way

to a lower guard number to fade any

disconnection next the mustache

consistency and density and volume is

important when trimming your mustache

start by combing the hair straight down

use your upper lip as a guide and trim

length just below the lift line don't

cut it too short or you will throw off

the shape a natural-looking neckline

goes best with this style of beard

you'll want to avoid harsh lines at your

neckline and cheeks comb your neckline

hairs upwards remove over growth by

flicking Clippers without a guard around

the perimeter of your beard line cutting

in the direction of hair growth same

thing goes for your cheek line using the

smaller teeth of your comb brush your

facial hair down your cheek trim rogue

hairs or flick Clippers in the direction

of your hair growth to remove anything

beyond the bulk of your beard now

there's a fine-looking beard trim your

beard once or twice per week depending

on your hair growth once a month have a

professional clean it up for more

my wife scarlet my daughter Clementine I

grew up outside of Madison Wisconsin on

a farm run around with cows and mini

bikes oftentimes holidays meant going on

a road trip spending time with family in

Arizona we had an old Toyota van I think

we racked up like five hundred thousand

miles on it for us our family time is a

few hours in the morning doing little

activities like laying with play-doh and

tinkering on cars a little bit before I

head off to work part of the traditions

that we've held on to is going on a road

trip packing up the bags and getting in

the car and we go down spend time with

relatives and our parents and sometimes

grandparents I'm Steven Smith and I'm an

agrarian adventure travel and lifestyle

photographer I rent an apartment in Los

Angeles that's my home base but Colorado

still feels like home for the holidays

I'm heading back I ride from here to

Colorado because once you get into that

desert you're just humbled by that space

and then you can get up and start to see

the Rockies all the way up to the Front

Range and then I'm home knowing that no

matter how crazy year is and no matter

how much I'm traveling for work there's

always that kind of light at the end of

Haute Couture

This haute couture jacket combines the

ingenuity of Ms. Chanel with the

extraordinary talent of Karl Lagerfeld

130 hours of handcrafting

and the close supervision of Mme. Jacqueline, head tailor

from Karl Lagerfeld.  The hand-drawn sketches began
to be examined, interpreted and interpreted

for customers, and more than 30 kinds of size data were obtained. The gray fabric

samples were pinned out on the mannequin with pins

. Adjustment, modeling, and carving

to reflect the shape and fullness of the drawing.

Open, and then splicing to
obtain the exact silhouette

front: high waist cut, more close-fitting to

make the back more rounded, feeling bolder and

high-open armholes
to make activities more free.

These are the secrets of Chanel's haute couture, generation after

generation,  It is said

that the 18 seams were assembled one by one and waited for
Karl Lagerfeld's confirmation. After a

quick glance, he decided to subtract two from the three-button design.  The





piping and buttons of this jacket design are

marked with stitches to mark the
length of the fabric.

Place the 18 seams made of gray fabric on the fabric and fix them. Mark the

edges with white chalk

and outline the shape around each piece with stitches

carefully.  Assembling each piece and sewing them together

is of course done by hand,
because only hand sewing

can reflect the true meaning of haute couture. Check the fit,

whether the overall harmony is
soft and elastic.

Give the coat to Ms. Jacqueline and

she will send it to Hong Kong  , London, Dubai, New York
or Paris, for the customer's first

fit Modifications: Extended front length
Tucks the upper arm sleeves towards the shoulders

Faithful to Chanel style

Hand-stitched jacket for a unique haute couture essence

Ensures the piping is perfect on the tweed  Join to

define the edges of the garment, define the shape,

trim off excess fabric, and embroider the buttonholes one by one. Sew the

buttons.

Chanel ladies would say, ""Buttons must have buttonholes""

Put small strips of cloth like cigarettes in the sleeves to ensure that they do not deform.

It's a 2 cm strip of cloth.

This ""inconspicuous little thing"" is invisible, but it can be felt.

It highlights our unique tradition, professional craftsmanship

and extraordinary craftsmanship.

Once again, give the coat to Ms. Jacqueline and

she will  Sent to Hong Kong, London, Dubai, New York
or Paris for the customer to have a second fitting

and then to complete the final modification in Paris.

Because Paris is the home of haute couture with stitched

lining, Ms. Chanel said that

""elegance is beauty both inside and outside

Attach the metal chain
This is the unique secret of the Chanel coat hem

Make sure the coat drapes beautifully Sewn

on the label

Hide the order number on the back of the label

Wrapped the coat

For this one-of-a-kind piece
Put a certificate of authenticity

and a few camellias, then close the lid of the box

24,Chanel,Coco – Inside CHANEL,"Chapter 5 Coco


Once upon a time...

There was a little girl who
concealed her humble origin all her life and

decided to create her own legend

Once upon a time...

There was a girl
named Gabrielle Chanel whose

father was a small businessman who wandered around

My mother was unable to do laundry for a
living, and died at the age of 32.



There was a father
who abandoned his five children

and sent three of his daughters to an orphanage.

12-year-old Gabriel never saw him again

Since then,
she has been pretending that her father went to America

Once upon a time... There was an orphanage

within the walls of the Abbey of Obasin,


where Gabriel lived for nearly seven years.

This simple Roman-style ascetic world

created  Her austere style

and preference for black and white were inspired by the

ornateness of religious clothing and ceremonial objects, which inspired

her fascination with baroque

gold and colored gemstones for decades to come.

Once upon a time...

There was a beautiful girl who
sewed by day  Making clothes Performing

in the restaurant at night

Singing for the cavalry officer

People call her ""Coco""

because she always sings that
""Who saw Coco then?""

She likes to pretend that Coco is a nickname her father gave her

Once upon a time...

There is a charming boyish young woman who

refuses to ride sideways like other ladies

even if the horse is the well-born cavalry officer
Étienne Balleson

Her clothes are also unique.

She drew inspiration from men's clothing

and invented a new style of women's hat. She
removed all the bird feathers on the hat to

make it simpler, lighter and more fashionable.

Her earliest customers were just ordinary occupations.  Women,
however, the high society soon flocked to

the past...

There was someone she once loved deeply, and
that was Capel boy.

He was British, rich, well-bred,

just the man of her dreams.

He introduced her to literature, the Orient  And mysticism

Capel boys help Coco become Chanel

She chooses to start her design career in Paris, Deauvier and Biarritz



She wants to win freedom and independence through work

Once upon a time...

Coco Chanel's magic touch

changed the way of women's clothing  The silhouette has

since sparked a fashion revolution.

She has cut her skirts to reveal ankle lengths,



liberated her waist,

discarded her corsets and
reinvigorated sportswear with jersey knits.

She also cut her hair short and got a tan.

Chanel ended an old era,  A
New Era In Fashion

Once upon a time...

In 1918,

Madame Chanel opened
her first boutique in Paris at 31 rue Cambon

A country girl from Auvergne

An orphan from the Abbey of Aubasin,
became  Queen of Paris

Before she liberated women, she liberated herself

Once upon a time...

There was a love story that ended abruptly The

Capel boy was killed in a car accident Coco

Chanel, for the first
and last time, cried in public

""Either he  Go,
or go alone to complete the cause we have created together""

She chose to face it with strength, going forward

bravely, to be continued...

28,Chanel,Marilyn and N°5 – Inside CHANEL,"  

Chapter 2
Marilyn Monroe and N°5 Perfume

""What do you wear to sleep?""

""Only a few drops of N°5...""

Maybe she was asked about it when she got off the plane?

Maybe at a press conference?

We might not know  Know, when did she say this for the first time?

April 7, 1952

Marilyn Monroe was 26 years old. For the

first time, she became the cover character of ""Life"" magazine. For the

first time, she talked about N°5  This famous quote was made public and

her saga with N°5 was born Photographed for Modern Screen,



882 North Doheny Avenue, Beverly Hills, October 1953



Marilyn Monroe laying on her bed...unknown

In each photo, there is a bottle of N°5 on her bedside.

These photos have never been published before. In

April 1960,

reporter Georges Belmont interviewed Marilyn Monroe for the French ""Marie Claire"" magazine.



She was at the time.  Filming of the
film ""Let's Love"" directed by George Cook and starring Yves Montand

Naturally, she talks about N°5 again

This recording has never been released before



Chanel obtained the interview in October 2012  For the

first time

we heard Marilyn Monroe herself talk
about the legendary ""A Few Drops of N°5""

You know, people would ask me questions

like

""What do you wear to sleep?""

""Wear  Pajamas? A nightdress?""

""Or a nightgown?""

So I replied: Chanel N°5

because it is true!

I don't want to say ""without a strand""

but...it's true

Marilyn Monroe and N°5, forever legendary

29,Chanel,The Camellia – Inside CHANEL,"Chapter 16
Camellia

I remember that
Gabrielle Chanel never said

why she had a soft spot for me,

but there are some things that are always self-evident.

I remember that Coco was a
girl when she was 13 years old.  The

stage play deeply moved

me. I remember
Proust and his well-dressed friends

wearing me on the lapel of the coat

to show elegance, harmony and androgynous beauty.

I remember

Coco borrowing designs from men's knitwear and

trousers.

I remember
the day

she had a sudden
inspiration and pinned me to the belt of her Breton striped shirt on the beach of Etretat.






A woman is
free to choose her own scent

I remember
I was so much like her

I bloomed in winter
We were always a season ahead of others

I was forever young
""No matter how the years pass, always charming""

I remember what
Chanel gave me that day

A lady asked her what she had for breakfast and

she replied, ""Camellia""










On the chiffon dress,

I remember that
she made me ever-changing, satisfying every whim. Embroidery

, printing, carving, pleating, fringe...

Chiffon, satin, organza, tweed, feather...

I remember the
first time diamonds  Glittering like dew on my flawless petals



I remember
every new creation

Rings, brooches, buckles, necklaces
Long necklaces, watches and pearl chains

I remember
how I bloomed in ceramics, onyx, coral

opal, pearls  On mother-of-pearl, sapphire, ruby

I remember
Karl Lagerfeld

creating the most gorgeous wedding dress with a bouquet of camellias

I remember

how my petals intertwined perfectly to form the double C

I remember
I am not a simple camellia

I am the flower of Chanel

31,Dollar Shave Club,Grooming with the BAMF Hammer-er | Dollar Shave Club,"welcome to i learned a thing in the

bathroom from

dollar shave club where we explain

something very complicated in mere

minutes

to occupy your brain while you shave in

this edition we'll be discussing

the science of morning wood as explained

by someone who

sounds smart because he's british

morning wood

or to give it its proper name nocturnal

penile

tumescence is something that affects

virtually all men

but the reason why is probably a little

different to what you were expecting

i've always assumed it was related to

the naked supermodel dance party that

happens in my apartment every time i

fall asleep

it's like the tooth fairy only sexier

while that certainly is a theory

it's not the correct answer it's

actually to do with your sleep cycles

related to rapid eye movement sleep it's

triggered by a completely different part

of the brain to the one that gives you

arousal erections rapid what now

rapid eye movement sleep or rem sleep

it's a phase of sleep during which

you're likely to dream vividly

as you enter the stage your brain starts

to shut off various neurotransmitters to

prevent you from acting out your dreams

one of these transmitters norepinephrine

is normally what's in control of your

erections

specifically it causes vasoconstriction

of penis blood cells

actively preventing an erection it is in

simple terms

the reason you don't walk around with a

boner all day uh

in most cases at least it's uh just the

way i'm sitting

anyway i find what you are saying very

interesting uh please continue

right well so norepinephrine decreases

when you went to rem sleep and

testosterone-related activities commence

this leads to vasodilation or increased

blood flow to the blood vessels

ultimately causing an erection one

that's intensified by the fact that the

rem period becomes prolonged as the

morning approaches

the end result is most of the time your

alarm drags you out of your dreams

it's going to be bringing a chubby along

with it so

when does this all start to happen as

weird as it sounds morning wood can

start as early as in utero

that is while you're still in the womb

and it can continue right through life

until you die or at the very least

remain prominent until you're in your

40s

is it you know useful in any way

there are theories that it may be the

body's way of providing adequate oxygen

flow throughout the body

including the genitals it can also serve

as a way to alert you to the fact that

you need to pee

your increased bladder size through the

night stimulates the region of the

spinal cord which can cause a reflex

erection

this in turn wakes you up preventing you

from peeing the bed

this might sound like a stupid question

but

is it just men who get morning wood

that's not such a stupid question

women actually do experience the same

thing in the form of clitoral erections

it's just less visibly obvious when it

happens and far less of a pain in the

butt when they wake up in the night

needing to pee talking of which and on

an entirely unrelated matter that has

absolutely nothing to do with this show

i have to go put my bathroom rug in the

washing machine

thing in the bathroom

37,Dollar Shave Club,What's the Most Shocking Thing in the Kama Sutra? | I Learned a Thing in the Bathroom Podcast,"welcome to i learned a thing in the

bathroom from dollar shave club where we

explain something very complicated in

mere minutes to occupy your brain while

you shave in this edition we'll be

answering the question what's the most

shocking thing in the kamasutra

as explained by someone who sounds smart

because he's british

the most shocking thing most people

discover when opening the karma sutra

for the first time is that it's not

actually the steamy guide to intricate

sex positions that it's known for being

only around a fifth of the book covers

this topic in fact with the rest being a

philosophical guide to navigating life

relationships and marriage

well that's a bummer where did this book

come from anyway the kama sutra was

compiled over 2000 years ago by the

hindu philosopher vatsyayana

but because it was written in a very

complex form of sanskrit the sacred

language of hinduism it was notoriously

difficult to understand

when a more accessible version called

the ananga ranga was published in the

1600s the original was orbit forgotten

so how do we know about it now

in the 1870s british author richard

burton

not to be confused with the movie star

was attempting to translate the

yanangaranga but kept seeing references

to the original work he ended up having

to piece the kama sutra back together

from sections unearthed in libraries all

across india still it wasn't much more

than a curiosity in the west until the

1960s when the hippie culture became

infatuated with indian mysticism and the

book's popularity soared remember when

the beatles started adding a sitter to

every song

that's pretty much when it happened okay

but why does everyone think of it as

some kind of sexy sex guide if it's not

a sexy sex guide i just like saying sexy

sex guy

because there's always a market for sexy

self-help literature a few unscrupulous

publishers printed versions with just

the passages that deal with that stuff

one of these versions was distributed on

the internet in the early 90s forever

cementing the book's reputation as a

piece of novelty erotica well while i

appreciate the history lesson i can't

help feeling you're trying to dodge the

question here what's the most shocking

thing in the kama sutra and i want a

real answer not some of your repressed

british bullsh most of the more

memorable sex positions in the kama

sutra aren't shocking as such they're

just impossibly difficult to accomplish

there is one for example which suggests

that the man should sit on the edge of

the bed while the woman straddling him

bends right back until the top of her

head is touching the floor unless you

have extremely flexible anatomy that's

going to end in a very painful trip to

the emergency room

most of what's actually feasible in

there won't surprise the average person

these days a generation brought up with

the internet and before that

cosmopolitan is more likely to be

shocked by how tame it is than anything

else well now i feel unfulfilled and

slightly angry

you and everyone i've ever slept with

I see

[Music]

welcome back to another episode of the

ones who succeed

I'm Campbell Barron and today I am

joined by my wonderful guest Michael

Dubin so Michael is the founder and CEO

of Dollar Shave Club and for the few

people who do not know a Dollar Shave

Club is Dollar Shave Club is an online

subscription service that ships men's

razors and shaving accessories on a

monthly basis for a very affordable

price

Dhar shave club has over four million

members worldwide he was acquired by

Unilever in 2016 Michael I appreciate

you taking the time to talk to me thanks

for joining us so like most people I

found out about Dollar Shave Club to the

hilarious add our blades are great and

we'll get to that in a sec but I just

want to start this off with Kentucky

about where you came from your childhood

where'd you grow up I grew up just

outside of Philadelphia in a suburb

called Bala Cynwyd and then my family

moved to Bryn Mawr when I was probably

13 or 14 mm-hmm and what were you like

as a kid let's see as a young kid I I

was very I had a lot of hobbies or at

least I thought I had a lot of hobbies I

was hard to hold my attention because I

was into a little bit of everything

what about school did you enjoy it were

you a good student I was not a great

student you know like I said it was kind

of hard to keep my attention I was kind

of into whatever it is that I was into

and usually that was sports or you know

theater or the extracurriculars and yeah

I would say I was not the world's most

amazing student

so let's fast-forward a little bit like

when did you realize when do you realize

you wanted to be an entrepreneur you

were interested in that well I think I

always I think when I was younger I

always was interested in in selling

things I remember when when I was young

my sister and I and some of the kids in

the neighborhood we we would grab some

of my grandmother's stuff off the shelf

some books and some other odds and ends

and we would bring them out to the

street and put them on a table and just

kind of sell them to people driving by

and that was super fun

you know I don't I I don't know why I

found it particularly fun but there was

just something inherently exciting and

and and fun about about taking things

that other people you know found value

in and selling it to them and so that

was that was a fun experience I think

from a very early age I was I was into

that idea so Michael started his career

working for NBC in the media industry

however while working the day job he was

always coming up with new business ideas

like a tourism social network that he

started in 2006 but it didn't go very

far

that being said instead of quitting

altogether and giving up on

entrepreneurship

Michael simply brushed it off and that

really interests me so you started this

kind of tourism social network right

before Dollar Shave Club and I presume

really people said it's not gonna

succeed or it's gonna fail and I guess

they were right mm-hmm and but with

Dollar Shave Club people said that it's

not gonna succeed and it's and it's

gonna fail right and they were really

wrong so how do you know when to quit

how do you know when a bad idea is a bad

idea

it's a great question and I get this

question a lot I think it's I guess it

comes down to qualifying why your idea

isn't working is it work is it not

working because there really is no

consumer need for it or is it not

working because it's too hard for the

consumer to really understand what it is

that you're selling which can be the

case with a lot of service style

businesses or or apps even it's like

what's the usefulness for this you know

product so to speak is it not working

because you just kind of haven't gotten

the word out yet and it is a great

product and there is a product market

fit there are a lot of reasons why

something might not be working I think

is not working because you know you

don't have the right talent I think it's

important kind of always to look at why

it's not working and and dissect that

and dissect that as deeply as you

possibly can because the answer of

whether you should keep going or if you

should put it down for a little bit and

weight is always in the kind of why it's

not working there's there's a lot of

ideas that didn't work the first time

around in society and then 15 years

later people try them again and then

they work because the market had time to

catch up and sometimes an idea is just

too early that's that's that can be a

reason why it's not working you're just

too early to market you're ahead of the

market so I think that you have to be

really you know rigorous in your

analysis of why it's not working and

then decide whether or not it's worth

stopping or continuing so I asked

Michael one of my favorite questions is

entrepreneurship talk or are you born an

entrepreneur hmm is this because

everybody has business ideas right so

it's not it's more than just having the

actual business execution you have to be

able to with limited resources sort of

find a way to get the critical work done

and bring the project along you don't

have to bring it all the way home but

you have to be able to you know kind of

solve critical problems and weave it all

together to get an early beta version

lives yeah and so I think that's

probably the the critical skill is can

you can you argue a really good problem

solver whereas some people you know

you'd ask them to go figure out one of

the early things we had to do in DSC was

figure out how we're gonna ship right

and I don't have a logistics and

shipping background so what did I do I

said okay well that's a problem that can

be solved I'll just start at the post

office right and I'll start by googling

how do I ship my products and sure

enough there were a list of services

there that we're offering and you know

you test each one and you negotiate the

best rates and you go on and on but you

know you say to yourself how am I going

to weave all this together and solve the

critical problems and to me that's what

an entrepreneur does really well I think

you have to have certain traits to be

able to certain character traits

endemically that can't be taught to to

be able to be a successful entrepreneur

I think one of them one of those traits

is you have to be

relentless in in your commitment to

solving the problem almost to an

addictive level it's like nothing's

gonna stand in your way because you're

addicted to this notion of solving the

problem and bringing the thing to life

and then I think another one is seeing

you have to see how you can uniquely

weave together a plus B to equal D right

yeah and and that's something that not

all people have coming up I continue my

conversation but first a quick message

[Music]

so fast-forward a couple years and

Michael realizes a new business

opportunity he notices that the

experience of purchasing razors is

flawed and in most cases where there's a

problem there's a solution

I had always sort of bristled at the

price of razors and then the shopping

experience and you know I would milk the

same old razor over and over again

because it was you know easier to do

that than to go out of my way and spend

20 minutes to get these razors and you

know that was kind of when I was living

in New York where he had to walk by a

hundred drugstores on your way home from

from the office and then I you know I

had the good luck to bump into a friend

whose father had a warehouse full of

razors and that gave me the opportunity

to sort of test that concept that was a

few years later so Michael did test the

concept and launch the site with the

hilarious video explaining what it does

hi I'm Mike founder of

dollarshaveclub.com what is

dollarshaveclub.com well for $1 a month

we sent high-quality razors right to

your door yeah a dollar are the blades

any good

no our blades are great you know I wrote

that video because I had sketch writing

training and I asked a woman that was

also a friend of mine who I had who I

had studied with that in New York to

direct it and we shot it over the court

I wrote it over the course of a month we

shot it over the course of one day and

you know we edited it and we launched it

in March 2012 and I don't think any of

us were expecting it to go viral but I

think that what made it go viral was the

combination of a few different things

one was the content was good number two

was it was actually tied to a business

that actually solved the real problem

for guys which is that you know razors

were overpriced and the shopping

experience was pretty frustrating so so

it wasn't just like a funny video there

was a lot of funny videos in the

internet it was the fact that it was a

funny video coupled with this with it

with this business concept and I think

that's what sort of propelled it forward

each razor has stainless steel blades in

a levira lubricating strip and a pivot

head it's so gentle a toddler could use

it and do you like spending $20.00 a

month on brand-name razors 19 go to

Roger Federer

I'm good at tennis and then so you

launch with this video you created it

and how did you it blew up it you've got

a bunch of orders or people a bunch of

sign up after it aired how did you find

this how did that did you was it

self-funded did you raise money from

grace a little bit of life self-funded

it up until probably January of 2012 and

then we closed our first round of seed

funding which is a hundred thousand

dollars from an investor in Santa Monica

and yeah and that was and then but when

that was before the video went that was

all before the video went live and then

it went live do you think your razor

needs a vibrating handle a flashlight a

back scratcher in ten blades your net

sum asked grandfather had one blade and

polio and then it went live well we had

also we'd also then sorry we'd raised a

hundred thousand in January and they

were a psych I think a million dollars

right at the beginning of March and then

after that video launch a few months

later were raised about ten million

dollars yeah so then it launched and

then what happened and then we sold out

of inventory the site crashed it was

sort of a scramble you know I think I I

think I blacked out for six months while

while we just sort of scrambled to keep

everything going and hire a bunch of

people and scale up and and then go out

and raise more venture capital did the

site crash scare you or did it excite

you like that sound that's like the

probably one of the best problems you

can have it is I mean I thought that it

was going to be I thought that it was

going to be stopped paying for shave

tech you don't need and stop forgetting

to buy your blades every month Alejandra

and I are gonna ship them right to you

we're not just selling razors we're also

making new jobs Alejandra what were you

doing last month not working what are

you doing now waking I'm no Vanderbilt

but this train makes hay

I don't think any of us were expecting

the site to crash or for us to get as

much traffic as we did so clearly we

were unprepared for that but yeah I

think that's a scary moment because

you're you know you're in this one

moment you're you have this massive

success this unexpected success and then

you think well I might not be able to

cash in on it however as you know Dollar

Shave Club did cash in on it

and not just with revenue because in

2016 Unilever acquired the company for 1

billion dollars so you're building this

company you have a bunch you probably

have a bunch of users and then how did

that happen how did did you did you

approach Unilever did Unilever approach

you how did that we met at a dinner I

met one of their senior executives at a

dinner we started talking about the

industry and where we wanted to go and

have that complement it's one of their

own sort of strategic visions to reduce

their strategic imperatives to reduce

their you know reliance on traditional

retail and there was a lot of

opportunity for us to go further and go

further faster with them as a partner so

we like you mentioned earlier on you

have tons of ideas you seem like the guy

who has tons of ideas where do you were

used to yourself in 10 years

well in 10 years I'll be 50 and I can't

say for sure I'd like to say that I've

been able to maintain a successful

business track record whether that's

here or somewhere else probably have a

family and be able to give back in in in

measurable ways because I think that

anybody that's successful noblesse

oblige they they need to they need to

give back all right oh Michael I

appreciate you taking the time to talk

to me thanks for coming out appreciate

it

we are dollarshaveclub.com and the party

is on

I never did this for fame or glory or

any of that I wanted to start businesses

because you know I like to create and I

like to build and I've always wanted to

find a way to do that you know I think I

think most people as you talk to people

who started things they really if I

think I really believe it's a calling

mm-hmm like you get the message and you

pick up the phone and you answer the

call and then you go do it and there's

really no question

chalky color and it's amazing because it

works on every skin tone cool so now

wanted to make sure all skin tones were

covered I wanted it to look my perfect

skin not like makeup on skin these are

really cool you know they're magnetic

girl to have their color another

consistency there's on it if it goes in

cream to powder shows things I like to

look at these shimmer sticks like I look

at my clothes in the closet

oh wow just like one tape is the

invisible blotting powder I made sure

morning

it was a good one then tell me that

moment is happened but it's a near happy

y'all lookin bust it and this is why I'm

even here with this video today right

now cuz cuz I was doing the most last

night so we don't have fancy Beauty to

the rescue

we are making a brand-new concealer so

as long as you know you're Pro filter

shade we have a corresponding concealer

to match and you don't even have to

figure it out I like to either put it on

my hand like that my hand like that and

I have a lot more scarcity when I pick

it up and I put it on the brush if I'm

having it an early morning after a long

night you start blending it out with the

precision concealer brush so I usually

like to put up like this in the bottom

of my eye where I want a definition do

you see all this brushes buff that out

it's like milk no spots just look at

that especially with a formula like this

that dries down and mattifies eventually

you expect it to start getting tacky and

paint up but this formula does not look

at how perfect of a finish it gets you

over here it's almost like a filter no

caking no creasing

no it's just a bit like round her

blemish like this one I like to just

bend that out my concealer brush like

that is magic just goes away buffers out

I obviously haven't set anything here

before I could set that there's a little

bit of creasing right there sweep once

show you how to accomplish that look

starting with a whole little family

right here hey now cheeks out is our

cream bronzer and our cream blush these

products are really lightweight they're

also meant to be applied any way you

want to really but a brush is usually a

lot more convenient for me because i'm

always in a rush like makeup and out

but jennifer over here

i love a finger

so jennifer over here

i love to use my fingers

i do not use a brush it's meant to have

a marriage with your makeup your

foundation your powder whatever you have

on your face you can use this on your

eyes your cheeks your forehead so i'm

going to start on the lower end here

i'm using my bronzer brush here because

what works for the dry formula it also

works for our cream bronzer so you can

go right in like that and then you can

blend it out and have a little bit of

contour when i get to my forehead

i really go in because i have a big

forehead so i have to go for it

i'm saying look at it i'm pouring this

into my foundation that's already there

and look it just becomes more like skin

than anything else you can't tell that i

have on any makeup in this corner right

here that is something that's very

special when you're on the beach

or you just want to wake up next to your

man looking like you don't have on

makeup

check it out though we like things that

look like skin we like them to look

natural not greasy

who likes grease

not you know that that's i don't play

that we just do dewy

okay so as you can see i'm also

contouring my jawline same cream bronzer

the shade i'm using right now is honey

glaze because it's really warm and it

fits my complexion really perfectly it's

giving me this dew this glow it's

natural it's summertime so what i like

to do is use this color amber i like to

use it on the contour region because it

creates like a natural shadow and i'm

just going to line like that it's not

lighter or darker it's just a shadow and

it's there all day long and you can have

this in a cream formula now this is our

summertime base

and we're not done i'm going to show you

the second half of our cheeks out

just pat it on like a little paw and

then i go in a circle just to create

that little rosy cheek and then i drag

up a little bit into the jawline and

then if i want more i do more does it

44,Fenty Beauty,ARTISTRY & BEAUTY TALK WITH RIHANNA | FENTY BEAUTY,"[Music]

[Applause]

it's so exciting to see all of you here

welcome to my first ever artistry class

and beauty top fancy beauty before we

get any further though I would love to

introduce to you guys my two pros who

are gonna be helping me out today

Priscilla oh no my boy Hector ah so

today's gonna be fun feel free to ask

questions about of course what we're

doing no sneak questions and just

remember it's my first time so don't be

so hard on me okay all right let's get

started first I'd like to bring some

models out so we can start doing some

makeup would you like to see that let's

do it yes yes we're gonna start off with

the Fenty face the first step Hector

we're gonna start off with a soft matte

base using our pro filter primer have

you guys use this before

isn't it amazing you like it thank you

well when I was making it I really

wanted it to be something that just felt

really feminine and it wanted to be a

pinky nude that just had this really

nice smell and I wanted it to also feel

supple something that felt comfortable

to the skin and it works on every

complexion as you can see how does that

feel Halima

I like to wait until the product just

like sets into the skin of it the primer

and the foundation no there's no rule

with that because they actually marry

really well together so they're man to

even mix if you want to like shear your

foundation out even more just drop a

pump a primer in there you do that this

is perfect

yeah our lake when you go into the beach

oh you know like your boyfriend's coming

over you don't want to know that your

room makeup but it's there that all

right so we're gonna move on to the next

step which is our lovely delicious Pro

filter soft matte foundation so have you

guys tried the pro filter foundation

before yeah now when I was making this

formula I mean I have a really big pet

peeve about getting greasy who has a pet

peeve about me especially in pictures

right you're gonna red carpet in 5,000

pictures later you're like what happens

so I made this foundation just for that

so when you get hot for when I'm on

stage performing from when I'm just all

day out and I don't have time to reapply

you want something that makes you look

like you your makeup was just done five

minutes ago always comes in a range of

colors of I'm sure you've heard 40

shades we started with and so there's a

color for everyone in here the first

woman I've seen put on makeup was my mom

and she's darker than I am so to think

that I would make a line that wouldn't

include even her it just I couldn't do

it she was the first image of beauty

that I've known you know so it was a

no-brainer for me but it's a shame it

took this long for everyone but I hope

that everyone can expand and wake up I'm

using 180 180 and halima was Halima's

number three ninety three ninety look at

how mad this is it already looks like

she's powdered and there's nothing but

foundation on her skin but it still

looks like skin it doesn't look over

powdery which I love because I don't

like makeup to look like makeup on top

of skin I just like it to look like

perfect skin

talk about the brush Priscilla I call it

a little paw this brush is so epic I use

this for foundation I use it to prep the

skin I use it for blush sometimes it's

literally the perfect brush I think

because of its density it just blends

the foundation and seamlessly and

quickly like I'm always on the way out

the door so you just want something that

you can dip in that and dip in that and

use in different parts of your face and

in different areas and on different

products for different finishes this is

one of those brushes what I'm using now

is the sponge there's many things that I

love about this sponge for me I've never

want to put a but a sponge down that

just rolls off to the shape is so good

because with the flat side you really

can capture a big area and the cut is so

unique because it really allows you to

go around the nose area around the lip

area especially I'll give you retouching

throughout the day it doesn't disturb

what you already have done I'm using a

sponge damn what it really does is

mimics the skins texture so allowing the

foundation to really look and feel like

skin this right here I usually like to

use that corner for like really really

tight under the eye this is really good

for powder the flat side it's also

really good for applying foundation but

I'm I like to do this this site as well

when it comes to foundation I like to

keep it rolling around so you could just

put it on really heavy and just blend it

out huh that's why it's cut yeah I

wasn't trying to save money we've

actually method to the madness all right

the next step and one of my favorite

little prod matte stick to set it yes

you're right the packaging is one of my

favorite things about this product you

could dump all of this into one bag it's

not moving anywhere it's not getting

uncovered it's all slammed together and

perfect what color are you gonna use

right now I'm going to use the color

espresso espresso my ultimate favorite

like I use it as an eye shadow lips

contour such a universal color and it

was great on all skin tones I like to do

contour first because it allows me to

really just shape the face show them

what you working with

given that jaw lines right I'm gonna

start with concealer first we like to

warm it up on the back of our hand

to kind of warm it up and activate it a

lot of people when they first go into

their matchsticks they notice that they

might be a little bit dry but that's

what they're supposed to be like because

they do have more of that soft matte

finish so a little trick to get it

creamy just activated by warming it up

on the back of your hand and then you're

going to see boom color payoff so rich

but then when it dries down it just like

locks into the foundation and it lasts

all day and it won't budge

so I'm going into contour next so I'm

gonna mix a couple I'm gonna mix a

little bit of amber and a little bit of

suede to kind of get the cool but

forgets about our amber because amber is

a people look at this and they get a

little scared right it looks great right

you're a pro if you're asking all the

right questions you're not scared of

amber thank you

all right so Priscilla's gonna show you

guys how to use amber cuz it's not that

scary yet it's like the perfect cool

tone contour for fair skin a lot of the

times I feel like fair skin also gets

overlooked and contours can sometimes be

to oranjee or be to golds but Rihanna

made the perfect undertone and the

perfect tone for contour so since Vitas

in the 100's but she's in the later 100

so she's fair skin but just a little bit

of color so I'm actually just gonna mix

in a tiny bit of warmth to it but it's

literally the perfect contour if you

just want that sucked in chisel cheeks

show them the jawline like get into that

over there you want to see that goodness

it just gives you that perfect shadow

for my skin tone I'm 270 whoo and I

suede is like my perfect color it's not

too warm and it's not too cool it's like

the perfect tone for me I like to do

conceal laughs just because I feel like

one of the things that wears off the

quickest so what I'm doing here is using

the color wheat and I'm using over my

all over blending brush and my sponge I

like to go a little bit lighter and then

slowly go ahead and

I want to choose a little bit her cheeks

I want to go underneath it questions

about the matchsticks feel free all

right let's get her a question I don't I

set things with powder and I actually

made these formulas specifically so you

don't have to bake and do all of that I

like as little steps as possible

I like to just get to it you know thank

you thank you thank you so much are we

gonna go highlighting or mattifying you

like to mattify first right I'm that way

I'm that way also just so you know

there's no rule to that you can do

either you know I think that fancy

beauty is actually rethinking the way

you do makeup and today we wanted to

show you how you can do a full glam look

but still make the skin look like skin

we are not gonna bake we just use our

invisible powder I'm gonna show you guys

it literally goes straight to this

perfect matte I think this product is

pretty genius because you can use it on

any skin tone so don't be afraid of this

color it's like perfect

this is actually one of my favorite

products as well the invisi matte powder

as I tell you I am anti grease I love do

but I do not like grease but it really

gets that t-zone down and it doesn't

leave that really white residue it looks

white it looks scary but with your

application it can just disappear this

is why I designed products like this

because I can't walk into an award show

with a clutch full of makeup you just

need a couple things and usually by then

it's only the invisible adding powder

cuz I do sweat through my makeup

specially on stage and stuff like that

but the pro filter soft matte foundation

when I tell you this product is a dream

and it was tailor made specifically for

things like that cuz I can't reapply my

makeup in between songs you know like I

can't go back there for an hour and

start over so I have to make sure

there's something I can just pat pat pat

or block and and keep it moving right

here look at that and if you don't

believe me look at it

Oh

Alima whoa butter butter so I like to

play with the sponge I feel like my

whole life change because it's so easy

to use you just really does absorb all

the shine so gorgeous and your skin is

not fair just so you know not fair

I want to let add a little color to the

cheek I'm gonna use a little shimmer

stick so I'm gonna use the match sticks

in the shimmer formula so we have 30

total 20 are Matt and 10 have shimmer so

the shimmer ones I like to mix and match

and use them as highlight and flushers

as well and these are the fun ones you

have to warm it up to get it activated

into that nice movement something that

you can apply move around but then once

it's there it sets into this really dry

nice finish

leaving the dew still there on your skin

you can put it on your cheek you can

apply it into your eyes your nose bridge

depending on what kind of day you're

having you can even put it on your

collarbone depend on what you're wearing

or what you like to highlight it's

really flexible and I like flexible when

it comes to makeup because I don't think

there should be any rules makeup is fun

this color is bright and it's meant to

be played with and you should not be

afraid of it cuz it could come off in

seconds so don't be afraid to go there

you know and try something new and the

best part is that it doesn't budge it's

like the most genius product but still

has that really beautiful sheen this is

my favorite combination right now it's

rum and yacht life so I did a little bit

of rum on the cheeks but now I do a

little bit more drama so I'm gonna go in

with my

kilowatt who loves us I mean isn't is

the best thing in the universe of makeup

like if you guys don't have this you

basically debt

another really flexible product like

this is one of my favorite things I

probably said that a few times already

but I mean it I mean it I mean it one of

them kilowatt because it's so fun it

they're designing duels and also sing go

the trophy wife was one of our top

sellers from the singles it's like sold

out everywhere it's hard to keep on the

shelves but the duels are so fun because

it depends on what mood you're in you

can even use it on the eyelid you can

use the sparkle on your cheek you can

use the flat one as a blush you can use

it I like to go all the way up to my

forehead sometimes I like to get

dramatic and go into my hairline so you

can go crazy with this thing and it will

never ever disappoint as we all know

when we do highlight we like to use

these little tedious brushes but I feel

like for everyday people sometimes that

can be scarier because they're just kind

of putting it wherever they feel like it

goes so Rihanna created this brush to

actually perfectly hug your cheek and

apply your highlight seamlessly every

time look at that you just said it

perfectly you don't have to do anything

the brush just works for you look at

that oh I just get I get lost in the

therapy of it all and I can actually

just use the same brush dip dip dip this

is me being in a real hurry and I don't

have time to put things down you just

need to do it okay ah it's so good and

then you can go back in and just make

this even brighter on the tip right

there look at that just for a little

more highlight on top of the highlight I

already applied look at it it's a dream

sorry I get so excited about my own

stuff but

it's not pretty turn to the audience

girl show them what you're working where

the chica can brush what I love about

everything at such as a convention has

it so like if we do it on the lids

awesome for example like look more

wiggle it okay you saw that from there

too right no because everything it

touches

it's the perfect brush look at that so

we're gonna go into some looks now we

have the fancy face perfected so what

kind of look are you gonna do you're

gonna use the Moroccan spice palette I

see you have that out jam okay so for me

I want to go more for a monochromatic

burgundy look I think not only does it

go with the season but it overall looks

beautiful with her skin tone in the

shape of her eyes let make a very nice

and soldiery the Moroccan spice palette

who's used this palette before it I

wanted to make a palette that was

something you can use for everyday and

then still had a few fun spiced up

colors that you can like go there and be

a little more dramatic with but this I

cannot leave my house and go on any trip

without this palette this probably

hasn't literally every base that I need

to start my look you can start any

makeup look from this you can do a easy

daytime natural casual look and you can

also just start a smoky eye with it

I've been to Morocco a few times and

actually the thing I really enjoyed the

most about it were the markets like I

loved walking around and being immersed

in the culture and seeing all the

different colors and textures and the

drums and I enjoyed it and so when I was

making this palette it came from that it

came from those experiences and I wanted

it to reflect the things that I remember

about that culture what about you

Priscilla what are you gonna do how much

is something fun something sultry you

know we're here in Dubai I want to do

something kind of dramatic so I'm gonna

go for like purpley pretty tones so I'm

going to take a little bit of spy

strip and I'm gonna use it as my middle

tone but I'm also gonna mix a little bit

of cumin get it just to make it like

that perfect middle tones whoo blend

your eyeshadow out with what are you

doing over here

Tennessee so what I like to do is shape

my smoky eyes first so I start with the

lower lash line and then I just fill in

the center I love Hennessy and I'm using

my whole over eyes shadow brush using

just the tip of the brush just wiggle it

back and forth a little lash lines

that's what I love about this brush you

can literally do it very tight or you

can just drop it and create a more drama

is this all Hennessy this is all

Hennessy let me show you what Hennessy

look like just so you know you go back

home that one eye I use that to do

eyeliner at the top when you wet it with

like a tiny little brush you could just

make that line really you can use it and

smoke it out make it dramatic you can do

the cut crease you can do underneath but

let's get into this brush though another

flexible tool as you see hecto use it to

go in underneath the eye this is also

all my favorite things to do use on the

lid it's just perfectly just right there

swipe one of the most important brushes

when it comes to eyeshadow you can also

bend with this brush as you can see that

the tip is still a little bit fuzzy so

there's a little bit of like you can go

in here in the crease and just get crazy

get precise I'm gonna finish off the eye

weights a little bit as kin a lot the

great thing about Rihanna's is she

created all products that you can use

everywhere which for me as a makeup

artist is essential you know I've always

kind of dug around my kid kind of had to

make seeing certain other things and put

them in different places but that's like

your philosophy and I've learned that

through you so I'm gonna do kilowatt on

the eyes that's kind of like the main

focal point I'm gonna take a little bit

of this beautiful color minted mojito

super gorgeous and I'm gonna wet my

brush just a little bit of water and I'm

gonna dip into here and I'm not playing

on the eyelids and it's just gonna give

this beautiful blue payoff so that's the

thing I love about Santa beauty is they

you don't ever have to be afraid you can

use things that make you feel artistic

and that inspire you and

for me that's one of the most essential

things when it comes to make up whatever

you Hector give us your final step right

so what I'm going to do here now is give

a little bit of texture to my look with

the one and only mr. trophy wife really

I think I just about you tell me where

you want me to put it I would put selfie

Y inner corner alright let's see look we

gotta be like really really go so it

pops against the smoke oh la la look at

that wait you're blocking it but and see

do the next movie alright let's finish

this off with a nice lip stunner force

than a week or my damn but the people

already know Donna it is what about you

Hector I think you just don't want to do

like a Sochi lab what do you think I was

thinking Griselda madam no go Griselda

or PMS not madam this is the end of the

first half of our artistry class and

beauty talk so I'm just gonna have you

guys check our girls out for just our

gorgeous and what about Rita oh you

given like smiles over here yes do you

see what makeup does to girl she does

not come in here like that she did not

walk in here like that all right ladies

and gentlemen have fun and I'll see you

guys in about 20 minutes

thank you

[Music]

did you miss me make some noise so these

ladies I've already been prepping

backstage with they're beginning stages

of the fancy face which is the

foundation and actually Hector has a fun

fact so what are my favorite things to

do personally is to do my complexion

with matchsticks

so he wanted to show you how beautiful

match six looks all over the face I did

foundation concealer and contour using

matchsticks there's nothing on her face

but matchsticks just so you know even

that nice bronze look over here on the

forehead all all matchsticks he hasn't

even put powder on her ass he's gonna do

that next

and Priscilla I'm gonna warm up the eyes

a little bit I'm gonna take matchsticks

and espresso as you can tell matchsticks

is like one of our favorite products

honestly as a makeup artist I feel like

I have just matchsticks I can literally

do a full face lip eyes cheek everywhere

and then how Hector did it on the skin

amazing so I'm actually gonna use this

as eyeshadow I'm gonna do her crease I'm

gonna use a little bit of espresso it's

just like that perfect contour shade

remember is very important to always

shape with something more neutral as is

your guide and then you add your color

one of the things that I've learned from

you that you always like like to apply

your contours first and then you add

color which i think is genius

so I'm gonna shape it with espresso you

start with the outer corner here first

to create this shape that I'm going for

if this allows you to also see the eye

shape cuz sometimes you think you know

and you're assessing but really until

you don't play your neutrals you don't

know how much you want to do so subtle

was so effective let's do a little fly

liner let's get into this line liner

have you guys tried it the little tip is

like super fine so you can do your thin

little line and then you can also do

more of a thicker line if you press a

little bit harder and it look how black

it

it's so dark and it stays black you know

you get like those eyeliners that dried

down and then the turn like this gray

Matt greenie kind of color drives me

crazy and so uh this was made with that

in mind you want to put on black

eyeliner he wanted to be black when you

wear it right let's go back to Hector

and see what he's up to

oh where did you do this with

matchsticks mash six as my shaper now

I'm just adding a little bit of saffron

saffron and then taking your spice

palette it's just really smoking this

house so this happened here

the only reason why I laughter that did

it on purpose you can see cuz not what

we want to do is just set that lid using

invisi mat as you know is one of those

things that naturally happens if you get

a crease and that's okay

you just wipe it off with a q-tip and

then just set that lid with a busy man

and he's doing it was saffron I just saw

him mix a little bit of this color into

priscila where we at Priscilla oh my god

a little bit of fun over here

are you putting gloss balm on our cheeks

sure I'm another secret that I learned

from you how many secrets have I learned

from Rihanna all right I learned more

from you I just don't I'm I've seen you

put it on your cheeks I've seen you put

it on your eyes it looks gorgeous

look at how the gloss mom just slides in

and it doesn't leave that line of like a

patch of grease you don't see her

fingerprints or anything on her face did

you take up the diamond balm yes right

here I was like it was right there and I

know it I I was having some okay but

just look at this formula guys oh it

like honestly it's like jelly but powder

at the same time it's so trippy just

feeling it is amazing but look at the

payoff on my hand

this is amazing I love you guys could we

like hang out everyday

you want to put some line about makeup

and stuff you want to put some on yeah

why not

so this is the kabuki brush right here

this is is designed to do very special

things I'm gonna start with her shoulder

look at that can you see that cameraman

are you getting that let's do the

collarbone as well because you know

these are the things men don't really

notice they just know something's

different

look at that like a dream like a dream

it looks like liquid do you see that it

looks wet it's not wet it really isn't I

can again I can do this a thousand times

in a circle until like my whole body

becomes this palette alright we're gonna

check in with Hector okay so one should

teach this beautiful artist how to

highlight the really way this palette

was created by the sunset my two

favorite colors together orange and pink

is really unexpected but they're

beautiful and it reminds me of like a

lot of stuff my mom used to have at home

but check this out he can do the pink as

a blush you can also use the orange as a

blush depending on your skin tone

depending on the look you're going for

if you just want a little bit of hint of

something but not too much the orange is

really subtle and really beautiful I

like using the orange on my eyes also

cuz kilowatt is just one of those

flexible products that you can use

anywhere and and do anything with

she asked me about eyelashes

there will be no stone left unturned

okay I am serious about my makeup okay I

want you to come into Sephora

stop at you fancy beauty counter and

leave okay that's what I want so don't

you worry so I think it's time for a lip

- [Messay] Building men for others is

what we talk about every day.

The young men that we coach
that come to Saint Frances

They've had adversity
or things in their lives

that your average athlete,

student athlete or just
your average teenager,

doesn't come across.

You talk about being
hungry for an education

or being excited to be educated.

But some of these guys have to worry

about if they can eat day to day,

depending where they're coming from.

- Saint Frances been helping
under privileged kids

and kids of color and for years,

even before the football thing.

- It would be impossible for me to deny

that maybe 90 percent of the
people who are affiliated

with Saint Frances heard
about us because of football.

It is indeed the front porch,

but when they discover

what we did long before football got here,

they really embrace it and
fall in love with the place.

- 1828 is when the school was
founded by a woman of color,

Mother Mary Lange,

and the school was founded
out of social disobedience,

in that it was illegal to teach

the children of slaves how to read.

And back in those days,

African Americans in this
city couldn't own property,

unless it was by a cemetery or prison.

So we're right across from the prison.

- I seen that jail for what does,

I could have been on that other
side of watching the school.

I don't wanna live that life.

So I decided to learn from not really,

just by looking at it.

(upbeat music)

- You got schools that don't wanna play us

because they think we're too good,

and it just puts further
constraints on the program

us playing and so forth.

So, despite that,

these kids have really done well,

the amount of scholarships
this program gives,

all through the support of Biff Poggi

and the other coaches who's helped.

- I don't know where I'll
be without Saint Frances.

- Made me a better person.

Made me a better man in life.

- It's a small little school next to jail,

does the unthinkable.

when they get to a point

in life where they have to
provide for someone else

other than themselves.

We're gonna show who we're playing

that we are the best.

We just don't look the
part, we are the part.

Everybody understand that?

I always tell my guys that
this day can be better

than the day before
and the way you do that

is you get up.

You gotta look at
yourself through a mirror

and figure out what's
missing and then get better

so every time you get up in the morning

you're always looking at

is here and I'm so excited to play with

some color this vibrant blue smokey eye

is very wearable and not overly dramatic

but fierce enough for a night out

as always I'm starting with primer la

bas acuatic will help your eyeshadow

stay on longer and brighter throughout

the night

now dip your fluffy brush into this nude

shadow and apply a soft wash of color to

the area between your brow and lash line

you can't really see this nude shade on

my skintone but you'll feel it once you

start blending in other colors pick up

the chocolate brown shade and begin to

trace out your natural fold I'm using

brush number 16 which is a fine edge

defining brush add a bit more to the

crease and don't worry about being

precise at this point as long as the

general shape is there next winged out

the crease connect and darken the outer

corner now pick up more of that nude

shadow and use a stiff number thirteen

brush to diffuse and soften the brown

shadow a stiff brush will help you erase

some of the harsh edges and in turn will

create more of a smoky look for my lid

color I'm applying a thin layer of this

bright blue ombre Hypnose stylo and I'm

adding it to the lower lash line as well

this step is optional but it will make

your eyeshadow practically bullet proof

waterproof for sure pick up the darkest

blue shadow with number eleven brush and

apply it over the ombre Hypnose stylo

sealing the lid color by patting it on

look how bright and pigmented that is

this color is everything use the edge of

the brush to add it to the lower lash

line as well now go back with that

pointed number sixteen brush that you

used to apply the chocolate brown and

blend the edges where the blue meets the

brown you don't need to add more shadow

just use whatever is left on your brush

dip a flat number eighteen brush into

the lightest blue shade and use it to

highlight the inner corner then dip the

same brush into the medium blue shade

and add it to the transition between the

two blues to create a soft gradient

effect and don't forget the lower lash

line now I'm using black fishness gel

liner my absolute fave to define my lash

lines and complete this eye look

I'm adding it to the top lashline wing

optional and both water lines tight

lining the top for an extra smoldering

look as a final step I'm defining my

lashes with definicils mascara which is

another fave and on my lips I'm wearing

this coral Alizee juicytube

it feels so good to wear some color

after a long winter and now I want to

see you try it

so i'm going to tell you a little bit

about lancome's new genifique eye cream

and how i like to use it

first you take just a little bit

of the cream about a pea size mix it

together like this

then you take both your index fingers

like this

right underneath your eye and you swipe

three times and then you take your two

middle fingers

and you go right above the eyelid three

times the magic number

now onto the next step you take both

your fingers again on both hands

you hold it here and as you move it out

you also separate your other fingers and

you massage outwards

and then obviously we have to do the

other side

very lightly and smoothly three times

and now on to my favorite part which is

kind of like playing piano on your

eyelids

voila my eyes are brighter and stronger

difference was noticeable immediately

for step one this is the charcoal

cleanser this is especially great for

anyone who works out frequently like I

do is outside all day or just really

wants a deep pore cleanse to remove

build up from dirt or pollution the

charcoal absorbs impurities and helps to

detoxify your skin step two this is the

exfoliating rub lumens exfoliating rub

is made from charcoal and rosemary leaf

extract now I use this no more than

three times a week to help with skin

regeneration and remove dead skin and

build up it also helps prevent shaving

irritation and over time has actually

reduced the appearance of acne scarring

step three this is the moisturizing bomb

Lumen offers a more tailored variety of

moisturizers depending on your age and

your skin type I have combination skin

so I like to use it every day before I

go to sleep and in the mornings when I

have areas that are dry

102,The Man Company,Gentleman tum hi toh ho yaar | Celebrate self-love,"No one has ever written poetry on your eyes,

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses.

You wander floor by floor,

cleaning the world,

As if hanging from the sky.

But when you see a mirror, and take a pause,

Man, you slay!

You, who don't let fights get ugly,

when you steal a glance to look at your clothes,

you really look cute.

In the traffic's rage

you sound like an Indian classical flute

And when you bring flowers for yourself too,

Man, you slay!

You take time out of ledgers

and make time to read a book.

Those years of struggle we spent together,

I never remember that as a bad phase

You share everything except your recipe

You dare so much, and so casually

When you almost get smitten by yourself and smile,

Man, you slay!

But when you keep your negative vibes in trash.

And instead of taking care of your ego, you take care of yourself.

You look mind-blowing.

Yet. no one has ever written poetry on your eyes,

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses

I feel I can cross any river when I am with you,

The one who is called a Gentleman in English,

My friend, that someone is you.

you know the head of their

like this

[Music]

hello everyone this is ankus bhagna and

you have tuned into yet another episode

of the gentleman show by the man company

aspect discussion

acceptance of people who we may not

necessarily

the conversation has changed and we need

to keep up with it and you know the

owners of learning is on all of us right

we have natasha who is india's first

trans woman to win a beauty pageant

and we have arnab viswas who identifies

as a gay man and also works on diversity

and inclusion at his workplace hello

both of you how are you

how are you i'm good i'm good

i am good i'm good i'm just thinking

conversation body intention

and i'm just

and i just want to say start this by

saying that if i mess it up if i mess

something up if i say something wrong if

i use the wrong terms please feel free

to correct me because i feel um it's

just very

important to uh give out the right

information and opinions about this

particular topic and um to all my

listeners i want to say i know your

topic to maybe what heavy

but

i feel that it's high time that we talk

about these things quite openly and um

i'm pretty sure that everything that is

said on today's podcast is going to be a

learning for someone or the other yep

okay so i'm going to start with you know

full form with the lgbtqia plus

which is like a blanket term for a whole

community which is like a wide spectrum

of gender and identities and sexuality

and whatnot so lgbtqia plus stands for

lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer

intersex and ally and there's a plus

because

i think the plus is there because um

you know

till date we have come so far with so

many genders at the moment and the

different um

virtues of being born in this world

right so i think it's going to be more

than plus so i think what's your

pleasure would

it's more about you know you we want to

cover everyone because there might be

people who do not identify as

one of them and any of these

existence is still valid of course so

that's the reason and we are unaware

about it so that's the reason we you

know want to cover everyone and be more

inclusive and that's the plus

basic questions

because i feel that

we get

like they've heard transgender but they

don't know what cisgender is yeah so up

uh can one of you or both of you define

for me

cisgender transgender

what is intersex what is cross-dressing

let's just you know clear them first

before answering this question it's very

important to know that what is sex at

birth

what is gender and what is sexual

orientation so let's start with that sex

or gender make africa sex i mean sex is

good and gender

wow okay

gender is uh you know i am born uh i'm

assigned male at birth but then i don't

think from my heart and mind that i'm a

i'm a guy okay so then i am identify i

identify myself as a as a as something

different than my assigned than my uh

sex at birth

someone is born male assigned male 1

i'll tell you my example i'm i'm born

with sex at my sex at birth is male so

is mine yeah yeah i i identify from my

mind and heart as a male so i'm a

cisgendered man

okay so i am also cisgendered man so if

you if you were born to all my listeners

i'm just explaining if you are

assigned

male at birth and you also identify as a

man then you're cisgender yours is

gendered and now sexual orientation is a

very different thing now as a man i am

attracted towards another man

then it's i'm gay and that's got nothing

to do with your gender that's not got

nothing to do with this other two you

know uh fields which i've explained so

but you know i would not say that i'm

100 correct because it's a very very

difficult and complicated topic so i

think there are always difference in

opinions and we are we should be able to

accept those opinions i'm saying that

gay people

can also be cisgender

yep i'm a cisgendered gay man right

understood okay and natasha tell us

about

the difference between like

transgenders and cisgenders

so like what happened was um when i was

born so i was assigned male and birth

but um as with time i grew i decided

that um i wasn't i was not in the right

body so i want to change i want to

change my

you know what i was assigned at birth i

wanted to be a female i want to be a

woman so i underwent transition and i

underwent my surgeries and everything to

be called as a woman at this point of

time so what happens over here is that

um

i've transitioned to be a woman and when

i talk about the cisgender women is

someone who is assigned female at birth

or women at birth so that is exactly the

difference over here

so in in simpler terms like uh

transgender people are people who are

assigned one thing at birth right but

they identify something

gender right the one they have so then

do they have to undergo surgery to be

trans

not necessarily i think it's a very

great question because um you know bob

to my belief that i wanted it so it's my

free will to do it so someone there like

there might be a lot of other twins

women who do not want to do it so it's i

think it's a free will also

accessibility

definitely

yeah it is expensive right i wish it's

covered by the government someday

whenever actually

questions so cross-dresser or

transgender mecha

so you know let me put it like this when

i started my transition

that was back in 2015 long time ago so

what happens over there is there was a

phase in my life where i went to my

psychologist i went to my psychiatrist

because it was necessary to have these

two people the signing before my

surgeries happen because they undergo

rigorous um evaluation to understand

what they are they really wanting to

be of the opposite gender right so

whatever what happens over here is um i

had to cross this for a while to

understand how it feels to wear a bra

how it feels to wear a panty i'm just

going a little bit more inner so people

understand how does it feel when i wear

a dress so over here

i feel good so that is exactly i was

given that green signal that yes you can

go ahead and have your surgery right so

when it comes to cross-dresser a person

doesn't necessarily have to

have i mean have a surgery undergone

why because you know the person is happy

as what the expression they are showing

so again over here then comes the

non-binary

there's a lot of it's like a chain

enough like incan link we've talked

about men we've talked about women we've

talked about trans people there is like

there are non-binary people there are

gender fluid people also right joe who

don't so can you explain what gender

fluid people and non-binary

so people believe see

we have always lived in a world where

everything is defined by binary a male

and a female and one yeah so those are

the two digits right so it is high time

we understand that there can be

different uh you know kinds of people

within that spectrum of zero and one

some defined some undefined some yet to

be defined

and that's where non-binary comes

non-binary means it's a non-zero or a

non-one it can be 0.1 it can be 0.4 so

how much you know towards male or

towards female you know those two

binaries i feel like so they don't

necessarily identify as either basis

either way then also i know one

particular one but suppose i'm dressed i

feel like a man today it might happen

that tomorrow i feel like a woman so i

don't define it you know

regularly but then that's how i feel i

can't help it so those are non-binaries

okay and it's

it is none of your business what another

person identifies

one point i always make angus is that uh

whenever you are you know trying to

break out of the rule you become an

exception and an exception always stands

out

so no one wants to be an exception in a

given point of time if someone is trying

hard to become an exception out of uh

the in spite of facing all the ridicule

and you know the hap you know all the

fun being made at that means just

imagine how strongly that person

believes that this is what i want

exactly

i think that's where you know i can i

should put a word here because um

how badly i needed that right and how

badly i needed that body because

the feeling is euphoria when you have

undergone your

journey i would say and

i mean i would love to share it here

when i saw my body first time in the

mirror

without i think skin is the best cloth

in on our bodies so

it feels euphoria

and that is exactly he just put it in

his voice

but okay so natasha i want to talk to

you about this whole journey and if you

don't mind sharing with us because i

feel that

it may inspire people listening to this

it may also

make more people understand what it is

really like to be trans and growing up

trans right right because i'm pretty

sure that

things were difficult before you

realized you know what being trans is so

can we start from the beginning can you

tell us about your story so like um like

i come from calcutta i was in a all boys

school in synthesis calcutta so

of course bullying has been a part of my

life

since um i was little feminine when i

was a boy when i was a young boy so

it's like

you know like those visions coming right

now so it's like um you know fighting

yourself every day when you go to school

and you get to meet your class friends

and

i remember staying alone from the rest

of the boys because i would just not go

out and play football cricket on all the

physical activities that guys would tend

to do during that time remember i'm

talking about 2015 now long time back so

then what happens over here is um

so like growing in that atmosphere

being called names and you know certain

way to behave then you go back home then

i think my only friends were my servants

in the house when i was young right so

since my father's father was an ice

officer i was staying in a huge house

and everything so i couldn't gel

with my other neighbors but the boys

were there so

it was tough but did you always know

that you're trans or it took a while a

woman i would say i always knew i was a

woman okay so deep down within me so i

think that is exactly i

knew from then

at what age what age was this i um

i remember going through a lot of

journeys that time when the first

internet dropped in into calcutta so my

father got the internet so we had

computer classes

and my elder brother who was in the same

school so he told him that you know i

think this is what i represent i feel

like i remember my brother giving me a

porn cd in class sevens class ten or

nine i might be wrong he said you should

see the chemistry between a male and a

female

that time and i was like okay i'm the

female right he literally switched it on

and said i'm going to go to the other

room and see what happens so maybe this

is a phase he told me it's a phase in

your life that eventually like the women

body i said no i don't want to you're

just forcing me to

do something that i don't want to right

and that's wrong and at that time to

reach i knew that so i think it was in

class seven when i started this

but did you know when people react like

that did it make you question yourself

did it make you

feel like

there's something not uh you know you're

different from other people well

definitely you know imagine um when a

child goes to school

and uh you've been boycotted not been

spoken to because of your behavior

called names like and everything

i think that breaks the spirit of the

child it breathes because the child

doesn't know right until you tell them

so it made me believe that i'm different

which i was not

you know so it made me believe that okay

i'm different because this is how the

world thinks about me so yeah that i

think it was tough

i would definitely say it was tough

enough is in

very deep thought right now do you

yeah are you thinking about your

experiences yeah because she's talking

about 2015 i came way back because i'm

much older to other people so over here

so

when i came out i mean i would if i talk

about my journey i think uh

my father expired when i was a little

kid and i was born and brought up you

know i was brought up by my sister and

my mother it was always the female

members who was surrounding me

so

many times uh it has been told that you

are gay because you were always

surrounded by women and as you mentioned

i've also heard

you know if you have a lot of female

energy around you so you know so it it

makes me

question their education because if a

girl is being surrounded by a lot of men

would he become a boy so that's my i

mean you know you know what i mean i

mean so you can't become yeah you can't

become this is not something which i

have chosen this is what i am

so and uh as she mentioned that i was

also not much interested in sports while

my cousins and all my friends were busy

you know playing table tennis and

football and cricket i was i was very

happy and comfortable with playing with

dolls but then

their rules were my i come from a very

orthodox bengali family so they're like

oh oh why is he not playing qriket he

should be you know he should be

going there learn character and all that

but slowly and steadily i realized you

know that uh i am different and i'm okay

with my difference

so when you are confident about yourself

when you self-accept yourself then what

the third person is thinking about me

doesn't make any difference so that gave

me a lot of confidence and also

my first boyfriend whom i met in college

that person made me realize that i'm not

the only one because i didn't have

internet access then

so when i saw that okay there can be

people like me i was already

self-accepted myself then i saw a third

person and you were like okay you're

huge was i'm like like both of you said

you talked about being effeminate as a

child right so did uh arnab and that's

that was your journey to realizing that

you're gay but there may be so many gay

people who may not be effeminate as kids

right

for sure i mean

this is not a formula there's no see

over the years we have uh we have marked

that okay pink is for women blue is for

men we have gender we have given gender

to everything possible

we have given characteristics to

everything so these are all social

constructs

i was asking my sister she has equal

potential like me that why have you

never you know

done something else why have you always

been a school teacher because she's like

you know we have been blown up in a way

brought up in a way that no longer

school teachers

scope

a few professions that were accepted

yeah so which is ridiculous but then

yeah right

so coming back to you

then

where did you go from there when you

realized that okay you're a woman

but did the world around you believe

that just because you believe that

well um i remember coming out to my

elder brother first and um

i would just not come out to my brother

to my father because he was very strict

sorry one second i want to cut you there

and ask you one more question did you

have any

did you know of any um people from the

community at that age or did you have

any role models in your family or

someone who trained i mean not from

their family but then uh as i said in

class seven when i had access to

internet i started googling uh different

transgender people and the first one

came was miriam rivera so i think she

was killed or something later on i got

to know but then a lot of other girls

like um there's news that i would like

to say that uh carolyn cossey was one of

the first transgender james bond girl in

back in 90s so a lot of people doesn't

even know about it

right so i started following these

people's journey read about them i can't

imagine having nobody

to talk to about this when you're

realizing such a big truth about

yourself oh yes and depending on just

the internet all by yourself that must

have been

yeah so like you know like of course my

internet one my computer was my friend

so i used to come and um

understand and you know try to get

things out you know in my mind and

everything so i used to like you know

process it in my head

and then finally tell my brother in

class 8 i remember and

one find i just say the spawn series of

no use because you know you're just

trying to put me in a box which i don't

want to and then um

so i knew like my father would be

totally against it since um i like our

numbers you know he lost his father i

lost my mother when i was in class six

so you know like um so i was in a very

strict vigilance by my father as a mom

and a dad both

so then i was was he supportive of this

he i mean eventually i would say he was

but initially no because he would just

scare me that you cannot do this and all

um it was totally against it

but i found my way to leave the city and

come and start it you left the city yeah

i left after my schooling

because i in class 12 i had to finish

three years since he was for 12 years

and

my father was you're going to davis

college and i'm like no i'm not going

because i have to stay back back in

calcutta under his vigilance

so

i had to just leave right so i started

applying for fashion colleges and he

made me sit for

clart exam eyes exam because he's a nice

person he's like you have to sit for all

these exams and i did sit for them and

um i just tick mark whatever i wanted

because i didn't want it to pass

was switching cities was this one reason

that you could not live your life

definitely yes my relatives were not

that friendly as well because they also

had been not great towards my family so

my father had to see a lot because of my

behavior like imagine in back in

calcutta we have this ritual um i'm sure

that you know when we have saraswati

puja we all cousins come together and

then we're having durga puja in my house

from 10 15 years by then

and my cousins would not be like that

friendly with me

so i would be like oh my god like it's

so bad right

it must have been very very hard yeah

even for you ernab like growing up

because

i'm guessing now your mother is very

supportive of it but i mean

right now everyone in the family is very

supportive including my cousins uh

probably ankush i would say uh because

it was way long back

i uh i generally don't blame them

because they were not aware

but because they were not aware i

i can't really say that i was not

tormented i was tormented because i the

problems that she just mentioned i have

faced similar problems and similar

issues in my life that you know uh why

are you dressing up like a girl why do

you want to wear a bindi

and at that point when i was in class

two and three i didn't know that okay

i'm not supposed to do it

i remember days where i was crying alone

and i could not even explain it to my

mother that you know why i was crying

because

i would be very ashamed i remember one

instance in my school i was in class

eight

my biology teacher asked me what is your

gender

she was making fun of me in front of the

entire teacher a teacher a biology

teacher

had it been possible i would have told

her name as well but then

because i named those evils yeah but

yeah yeah

but that incident was so scary for me

with 66 other because i remember there

were 67

students in the class

and others all other 66 people laughing

at must have been humiliating it was

very humiliating i don't remember what i

have done to

ask me that question and i might my

question right now would have been how

dare you and it was obviously done to

shame you and not to shame me it was not

a genuine question and

you won't believe me she was one of

those teachers in school whom everyone

would look up to she was dressed up very

smartly and you know she was one of

those fancy teachers i would say and she

asked me this question but till date

that incident is there in my fresh in my

mind yeah do you ever get like for

example i was also bullied as a child

and i feel that now i have overcome all

of that but one mention of these

incidents and they're very fresh in my

memory yeah so is it the same i'm sure

it was well um since our numbers

mentioned biology teacher i mean let's

not name these evil spirits you know

first of all so good for them actually

right now

right now yeah so you know what happened

over here was uh i had a teacher who

would imitate me in front of my 50 other

art students

so when that time i was in class 10

my icsc was on the way so

i remembered i think it was a maths

class or

yeah it was let's um let's not get into

too much of details as well so the

teacher comes and i mean i as a normal

student i would just say that i had a

question for

a certain number you know for like for a

certain subject right the syllabus so

then uh like he would imitate me

so you know i mean that's like and the

entire class would laugh

imagine teachers doing this they're

supposed to teach you and they're

supposed to be good role models

wow so the enter class would laugh and

you imagine that the teacher is there

for 40 45 minutes and teaching and he's

gone so what i'm going through the rest

of the day from 9 a.m to 3 p.m so you

know they would just um

you know they would do the same thing

because you know teachers are supposed

to be teaching students so if you're

teaching this to bully others you're

adding on fool to fire so that is

exactly

transphobia homophobia it's not deep

probably those teachers didn't realize

what they were doing no probably that

same teacher would behave completely

differently right now because i'm sure

she's a well-read woman and she wouldn't

evolved she has evolved so in my case i

most of the times you know uh pardon a

lot of people thinking that okay it was

way too back but that teacher i could

not pardon honestly

for example

now your parents are supportive are your

parents supportive yeah i think the

tables turned for me after i uh when my

father saw the first article in calcutta

news that i was the first kolkata trans

woman to win a beauty pageant so that is

where my turning point happened

so my father would um i remember not

speaking to him for quite a long time

because for him it was very hard to

understand that

um you know his son is a she now right

so

he tried all his best so

when you transitioned do you remember

the day when after the transition you

met your parents oh yes yes so i think

um the best part of my life was when um

when i won the pageant in 2017 and once

again for all the listeners transition

meaning that you underwent a surgery

surgery to call myself a woman okay i'm

just like like a physical surgery a

physical cemetery okay so you know buzz

what happened was when i went back to

calcutta so what happened was um

i met him right my father so for the

first time in human flesh he saw me like

that and

i met all his um

his colleagues

and the most shocking people

yes i met all his colleagues and they

kind of you know like inaugurated me

with the flowers because i made my

father proud right and there were other

ice officers high police officers and

everything and out of which one i used

to call g2 when i was young like g2 uh

in bengali we say that so

he comes and he was crying okay i think

he was not drunk then so you know he was

not drunken

he was he was crying and holding my hand

and his wife was there auntie was there

so it was only my hand i said uncle why

are you crying and then

he says then you know what natasha when

i was young

you can imagine when i was young he's

like plus 60 right

i kind of um

wore my mom's

my sister's frock

and my father would come and beat me up

beat my out of me that evening

right so

seeing you i realized that

what you have changed in our minds

so i think that gave me a lot of courage

and that's impact that's a huge impact

and i was i had to use in my eyes and i

was i'm getting goosebumps right now

because i think that incident was very

touchy in my in my mind that time i just

want to say i'm very very proud of you

yeah thank you honor i think one small

uh you know point which i want to make

crying

do you not think that sometimes i'm not

defending people but i'm just saying

sometimes sympathizing may be a way of

them showing support or is that not how

you're supposed to i think you should

show support we are talking about

equality no one wants normalizing and

normalizing the more you will sympathize

the bigger the problem becomes because

it's always you're always looked in a

different

look with a different special place

are you saying that if you tell someone

that if you come out to someone or if

you tell them your story

what is an appropriate response is there

any i mean i mean

depends also uh generally i would not

tell my story to everyone for i can give

you a small incident which happened

yesterday after podcast

i mean but then uh

i came out to a colleague like very very

uh you know

normally without any without much hustle

and but he didn't react and that's

exactly the reaction we want he didn't

react he didn't say anything but i was

thinking

you're so used to being giving you

some big thing has happened oh my god

it's fine to just have uh being gay is

okay

it's you know that you know so i was

talking to this uh trans person once and

she told me that

according to her it's very personal

that's what she said she said it's very

personal but i like the reactions where

there is no reaction

because that's the only time where i

feel like what i look like what my

identity is not a point of conversation

i tell people something they they're

like okay cool

and yeah that's normal that's

normalizing it in the real estate

absolutely according to her the younger

generation

they don't they care i mean most of them

the the i would i would actually not say

the younger generation in in total

because obviously we're talking about us

we are talking about a certain section

of the society

educated aware of you know social media

exposure exposure lives in metro cities

those those handful of people they don't

react

but is this the same uh you know

condition all over india all over rural

india i'm not sure i'm not sure of

course

i get on uh you know social media every

day

by putting up very simple stuff people

you know come back saying that you know

you are great you are a hero i said i

don't think i have done something

supernatural but those things trigger

you know those things make a huge impact

in their life but imagine

when like it's so interesting that you

said

supernatural thought but interesting you

embracing yourself

is seen as an act of heroism because

that's the right that's where we are

right i'm just being me

and that is supposed to be a statement

in itself because most people are not

allowed to be there right right

like

as much as i'm proud of you i also feel

um

people are not allowed to be themselves

yeah i mean many people call me

privileged for that i think we are

privileged but

how we best utilize that privilege is

also something in our hand i mean i can

give you a small example which one

activity we did in our office so just to

give context arnab uh

just company manufacture he uh does a

lot of work for the community yeah yeah

what do you do about total background so

i work in finance but then i also uh you

know lead the lgbti wing in my company

so

that way uh we have done a lot for

social inclusion of uh the community uh

but then in as a part of the activities

on push i would just uh just tell you a

small example uh we asked people to wear

nail polish on their you know one of the

fingers and ask them to hide throughout

the day

most of ninety percent of the people

came back with a horrified experience

that i can't hide my finger

imagine a gay person hiding his own self

throughout her or his life how difficult

it can be

you can't hide one finger i'm hiding

myself all over you know every every

time i come out

wow

i think they'll understand how it how

does it feel it's a great maybe a

fraction maybe a fraction i mean just

paint one of the fingers and then i ask

you to hide don't show this finger to

anyone throughout the day come back to

me and tell me how you feel tomorrow

running into their running into your own

shoes i really hope all the listeners

listening to this right now

well i think um

definitely yes thinking

it's a mixed feeling why because um i

think of course

little bit change has been

visible but then we are not 100 yet

could we have had this conversation if

it was not decriminalized

[Music]

you could not even openly i think see

being gay was never uh

was never a criminal act uh i mean

having uh being caught in a being caught

in a sexual position with a person of

same i mean same uh you know orientation

or same gender i mean not the right term

same sex same sex that was uh not legal

okay but then again we had other laws

joe

those were very complicated natasha what

do you have to say about this i think

have you decided yes or no of course i

mean little as i said i think i

mentioned you like little change has

been there but uh our number is right as

well like you know by education is

something that should reach each part of

this land so everybody understands and

what it is and without knowing how will

you know who is gay who is trans person

like you know till date i would say that

uh in 2022 if i go

uh to a village and someone will not be

if i tell or someone gets to know i'm a

trans woman i think there'll be

reactions still because education has

not reached in that land on that part of

india legally problem near

socially yes i think society society

wise there's a lot to do

we have not even near the ten

legally problems

because uh yeah

section 37 decriminalizes homosexuality

but it has not given us equal rights we

can't marry we can't uh have inheritance

of property uh we can't divorce we can't

do a lot of stuff inheritance is

property in returns a property from i

mean if i have a partner there is no

inheritance of property of by the

partner

how it is in the cisgender yeah partners

so there are multiple issues still there

so i mean whether i want to get married

or not that's a personal question

probably i don't option though but i

have to i should have the option of

saying yes or no

so i'm not very sure so i would not

comment about surrogacy and adoption so

i think there are problems there as well

so legally are we there we are not there

um

i want to ask you this

after you transitioned

um

it obviously changed the way you look my

life's changed your life changed right

has dating been

more difficult after uh

you know

your transition

so you know i will uh say that uh dating

live of course um

being on like of course i used to use

few of the social apps too

we're humans we want friends we look out

for new people

so then when i was like you know swiping

on you know men in the town

so there were times that um

i would get a lot of swipes because of

my pictures or maybe some guy likes me

or

but the way i look away i talk whatever

so you know someone has liked me and

then then comes the hard part

so before that hard part comes i've kept

in my mind i used to mention transgender

women

so i don't want to question that in in a

separate part does it put you in an

uncomfortable spot when the conversation

gets to there because you know what my

imagine i'm dating a sweet guy tomorrow

and

um a heterosexual guy

so

if the person doesn't know about my past

i have to say eventually right because

i've had a

incident like this back in bomby where i

was dating this guy so i just randomly

met him at a club in south bambi and

so he didn't know about me we met at a

club loud music and everything so he

didn't know about me and then eventually

i found that he was having feelings for

me i would hang out with him for coffees

and everything so eventually i had to

come out to him and tell him so then

it's like i'm liking the guy as well and

if i tell him i'm transitioning so my

111,Maybelline,How To Slay Back To School Tutorial ft. NikkieTutorials + Nabela Noor | Maybelline New York,"hey guys it's me nikkietutorials and

over here we have nebula and we are

doing a back to school makeup like this

I love to color correct I don't care if

I have 5 minutes 2 minutes 1 minute 30

seconds I'm going to color correct so

I'm going to show you how I quickly do

not repine Baby Lips today a baby winged

today honestly and I'm using a gel

pencil eyeliner but I'm grabbing a

little brush so I have more precision

and I can actually create a way so I

always do this because these are the

spots for I find that I have some

hyperpigmentation some and some darkness

but if you have dark circles or acne

scars find the master camera pen that

works for you I'm on your skin tone and

I promise you the results are so

beautiful and I love them so much I'm

going to be using my maybelline

superstay foundation and this is in the

shade golden I love this beauty sponge

okay I'm telling you like I can just

pounce pounce pounce pounce pounce and

be out the door and this foundation is

super full coverage super long wearing

so if you have a lot of stuff to do

after school this is your foundation

okay

I'm just applying a little tiny hair of

a lighter

and that's just gonna give me that

really nice like without the later can

you teach me how to do that sound I

would I'm gonna curl my lashes and then

apply a waterproof mascara this is the

trick because if you have straight short

lashes like I do you need a waterproof

mascara to hold the curl get the

centerpoint girl thank you

the only point I'm getting in school

another little trick I have is grabbing

your mascara and using it as an inner

corner eyeliner because it will stay how

longer I'm using the Maybelline fit me

concealer and this is in the shade sand

this might seem a little light but I

like really bright center points of my

face and then I use bronzer to really

warm my face up next up is my master

contour kit and I'm gonna use this to

bronze my face as well as on my lids

because this is this one kit will do

your whole face and I love the contour

in this kit because it warms up my face

so much and it also looks so great on my

lids well I'm actually just taking some

of the contour and applying it on my

lids the blush I'm using today is coral

I just think you look sweeter with some

blush mm-hmm

alright little trick for a dewy

highlighter at school you grab your Baby

Lips and you're gonna mix it with your

highlighter today I'm using the master

chrome mix these two together on the

back of your hand tap it on to the

highest points of your cheek wait I'm

crying at how good you look now I'm

138,Peter England,Peter England_Siddharth,"I think it's a huge honor PETA England

is a brand I don't have very few brands

India that you actually grow up looking

at as as describing words like honesty

and confidence and and and always good

intent and I think a lot of us not just

in my generation but even in the current

younger generation kind of subscribe to

the fact that PETA England attributes

itself to to confidence and and doing

things right and and succeeding in life

and I've been a patron high speed ending

as a brand I was younger I still do and

so it's a great honor to be a part of

this kind of a relationship and as an

actor it's always interesting when a

brand see synergy in you and the fact

that you along with the brand can take

it to another place I always believe

it's it's a two-way process that

whatever I contribute to Pitt England is

a brand be genuine contribute to that as

a brand as well so I think it's it's a

fantastic synergy that I'm really

looking forward like I said as far as

speed England's attributes they're quite

evident from what they do and the kind

of shirts and the kind of clothes that

they make they stand for confidence they

stand for for youngsters believing in

themselves and going out and achieving

what they dream of my films that I do

I've always thought that I've strived to

make films that are clean films that are

honest and try to reach an audience and

emotionally reach out to them on on

terms of honesty and good intent so I

think the synergy works on that sense my

fan base in the South where I come from

as well as in Hindi based on the films

I've done here is predominantly young

and it's always interesting to take a

stand-up brand like Peter England and

take it to a younger audience and so I

think that's an interesting synergy at

the same time it also helps that I come

from an educated background I am an MBA

by education and I think the thing it

also stands for for values of of knowing

what you are talking about and saying it

clearly so it's about speaking out and

speaking out clearly and I think that's

a good synergy as well to tell you a

little secret I've always enjoyed

wearing formal clothes ever since I was

a kid in school even if there wasn't an

occasion that deserved it I always went

out to buy a nice shirt and trousers and

a belt because believe it or not I've

always wanted to be older and I looked

at formal clothing as an extension of

that that desire so when I got older I

kind of enjoyed the fact that I didn't

need an excuse anymore I could look

mature without you know having too

reason for it but I don't eclis as I got

older people claimed I still look

younger than my age and didn't take me

seriously enough so I think a style

quotient for people like me who don't

get taken seriously too often is to is

to use formal clothing like this to be

taken seriously and and kind of sound

mature and look mature so I that but on

a serious note I have a very specific

style quotient which is it's it's it's a

quotient of comfort because if I'm not

comfortable what I'm wearing it's going

to show on my face and it doesn't matter

how expensive it is or who'd recommended

it to you it it's not going to be

stylish so for me clothes have to come

from within and and the reason I like

pretending is a brand also is that I

feel very comfortable saying the word

Spieth England and wearing their clothes

and it's that's a really important thing

to say

I should be comfortable saying I'm

wearing Peter England I think I look

stylish in it so I think that kind of

style comes true it's not really advice

I I can only tell you what I practiced

and I still think I'm young at heart and

quite young as well so for me it's about

believing in yourself

and knowing who you are it's it's very

important to like I mean I wouldn't want

you to just wear Pete England because so

that said bye Pete England

look it's you that wearing pretty

Englund if you think you've got the same

kind of confidence and attitude that he

has please go out there and put on

wedding in short and it will become your

own attitude it's about not having

somebody else's view of somebody else's

values but kind of making your values

come out with your clothing and your

style and I think pitting is the right

way to go I don't experiment too much

with my clothes I'm old-fashioned in

that sense I like simple shirts and

matching trousers so I'm not a back he

dresses it some might be in in the

current context of today's youth but I

say go with whatever you're comfortable

with I'd say a nice pair of shoes and a

good belt goes a long way and telling

somebody to see this dresser because

it's not just about concentrating on the

on the shortened trousers you also have

to look at the access the reason and men

only have these two to go with apart

from the watch obviously but we don't

have the the other advance the kind of

other assets that women can use in terms

of accessorizing

so I'd say a good pair of shoes and a

good belt apart from a crisp formal

shirt it goes along like I said it's an

absolute joy to be associated with this

brand it's a brand that that demands

respect not just from my father or me

but even from kids younger than me as

well and like it says on the board that

it's the beginning of good things I hope

that applies to both meeting and and for

me

and this relationship goes on to two

very fruitful conclusions and goes on

for a long time so looking forward to

that

Peter England the beginning of good

things

140,Rare Beauty,Get Ready with Selena Gomez | Meet the NEW Stay Vulnerable Collection,"hey guys it's selena gomez i am super

excited to show you how i got this look

today

and we get to use my new stay vulnerable

collection i started with washing my

face

and using moisturizer so basically

all i have on right now are some lashes

i'm individuals

and i'm getting ready to do my face

so i'm gonna start with my primer which

everyone knows is one of my favorite

things especially for a glowy look

i'm gonna use my hands with this

you can already tell too when i'm

applying it how it already just melts

into your skin

next i'm going to use the liquid touch

foundation

my color right now is 180. i kind of go

through this

dot application that i do there's so

much formula in it that

it's pretty pretty easy to spread around

and use my brush

obviously you can do a heavier

foundation look if you'd like

every time i use the foundation it just

starts to feel more and more like my

skin

and i feel like when i put it on lightly

i

don't feel like it's too far off from my

skin

because it kind of looks like i'm not

wearing any makeup right now

next is the liquid touch brightening

concealer

and with this applicator it's really

really easy

to kind of get into the corner of your

eye

i definitely love concealer sometimes i

can just use concealer depending on how

my skin is

again i like to do everything pretty

delicate so when i put my concealer on i

definitely do the motion that's very

soft and

in circular motion after i apply my

makeup

i always do another layer of concealer

and a pimple whatever now you can see

that it's super glowy

my skin looks really fresh um you kind

of can't tell that there's really any

makeup

and it feels really good that means i'm

now going to move on

to the always optimus 4 in one setting

mist

it's always my favorite give it a little

shake

about eight inches away

next i'm going to use the positive light

luminizer and that will be

an enchant i love all my luminizers it

goes well with different skin tones as

well

this one happens to be one of my

favorites i can use

some of the highlighter for the tip of

my nose and right above my lip but i

don't like

kind of focus on that area i keep more

of the luminizer

up into the higher cheekbones this is my

blot and glow

touch-up kit so this palette also comes

with some excess oil

papers if you need to tap i don't think

i'm going to do that right now i'm going

for more of a glowy

look i'm going to apply the powder

[Music]

under my eyes and then the sponge

put

so as you can tell i just kind of went

into my t-zone

kind of put the powder there a little

around my nose

now i'm going to use my liquid eyeshadow

and the color is nearly neutral they're

very tiny

and really really cute on the go so the

applicator

again similar to the concealer has this

sort of

edge feeling um and i'm gonna go in

more towards the bottom

of my lashes because then from there

i can move the product around it

definitely is high pigmented as you can

see

just barely without doing anything you

can see the color

around my eye and it's such a beautiful

color very natural

um especially when i move it around and

along with that i'm going to be using

the stay vulnerable all over

eyeshadow brush it kind of looks like a

finger you know

has a little bit of the slant i'm going

to go in with the shadow

and move it around

the shadow definitely wears all day it's

very as you can tell it has

got a lot of pigment and we've created

the eye shadow um so that it wouldn't

have the crease effect that most

shadows do this is our number one

selling product and it is the perfect

strokes matte liquid

eyeliner i was very very happy and

honored and excited when we got the news

so naturally i'm going to be applying it

give it a few

shakes make sure you have all of that

pigment and the color that you want and

start right here

and then i connect it all

again you go into that lash area make

sure that it's all covered

now i'm going to do the next eye now i

have my eyeliner on

we are moving on to my brows this is the

brow harmony pencil and gel

this one's in cool brown which is the

color i use it's kind of

i feel like for me if i want to do dark

i'll go dark but if i'm going natural

i'll use the cool brown

how i use it kind of get the

gel a little bit off i like to start

with brushing

my brows

i remove tons of the product because

then i use it at the end

and then i can use it so after i've done

that

i'll go in and kind of dust around the

area of my brow

i want to make sure i get it all in so i

usually start on

the outside so there's one eyebrow

super easy i'm gonna do the next one now

so here is one of the newer products um

it is called the stay vulnerable

melting blush and it is in nearly

neutral i call it a little pebble

because it's so cute and you can fit

anywhere

but what i'm using is the nearly neutral

color

i like to use my hands for this one but

people you can use the brush

you can use my brush that you like or

whatever one

i'm going to go tap it in

i'm gonna do a little bit on the apple

i would describe it as kind of a mousse

i feel like this is different from our

liquid blushes

in the sense of it's not as

prominent and it's kind of more of that

feeling that you want to use your hands

with i use

the liquid one when i feel very bright

and i want

more color but since we're doing a

natural look today

this is kind of the color i want

it looks a little like sun kissed the

finish is a natural matte

um and i think i i love that because

everything else on my skin is very glowy

so even when i kind of had some around

the luminizer it doesn't take away that

glow

which i love next we are going to the

stay

vulnerable glossy lip balm again in

nearly neutral

now these are newer and these are so fun

and

i just think that every girl wants a

good pop of lip gloss every now and then

i've been super into lip glosses right

now this color is also

really beautiful it goes well with my

skin tone can go well with

any skin tone really but i love how

brown and neutrals look on me

the applicator is also really amazing

because we kind of have this

hole in the middle that is what i call

it and it holds more

of the gloss so that when you're using

it

a lot more comes out as you're applying

the very tip is easy for me to go

and do a kind of liner effect that's

just with two dips already

the lip gloss doesn't feel like a

traditional lip gloss

sometimes it can be really sticky and we

stayed away from that so the color and

the texture

is very smooth and it kind of is easy to

apply

anywhere anytime without a mirror unless

you're driving don't do anything while

you're driving so i feel like this kind

of completes a look for me

the lips feel really great i still kind

of have this area

where my pimple is to be honest i'm not

going to cover it up

i think that the look i have right now

is nice and

it'll last me all day i'm really happy

with how everything turned out

and i'm excited for everyone to try it

as well

this look has been one of my favorites

and

i'm excited that you can use it and

share it

and show me all the looks that you do

which have been amazing by the way

thank you guys so much for hanging out

with me today show me your rare beauty

routines

and you can tag at rare beauty i'll see

you next time

[Music]

everybody does that okay

i have

[Music]

that'll be good for the boomerang

[Music]

okay so what i love about

this primer is that sometimes i can just

get away with wearing it and it gives me

this like dewy fresh look

when you use it with the foundation i

love how it kind of gives you that

little dewy effect and it kind of

shimmers underneath the makeup and you

can kind of tell a little bit

brighter done while i do and prep my

makeup

i want to use honor

to moisturize my lips let that sit in

now we are moving on to positive light

tinted moisturizer

for the tinted moisturizer i would

suggest using your hands if they are

clean and prepped and ready to go for

your face if not the foundation brush

works well as well

i don't really like to use

any sort of

i guess method behind tinted moisturizer

because essentially you want the tinted

moisturizer to feel

like your normal moisturizer

and it has obviously a little bit of

coverage but not too much

and it also has spf 20.

it goes on really easy and it feels just

like a light moisturizer it doesn't feel

thick it doesn't feel heavy oh it's so

pretty i'm so happy the liquid touch

brightening concealer

what i love about this is our slant so i

can kind of go in a little bit

in the corners and then use the

thicker side of it to kind of go into

the eye i love concealer so not gonna

lie

i sometimes go a little overboard

if i feel like it

shooting season one of only murders in

the building was really nerve-racking i

didn't quite know

what was gonna happen i just knew that

we were gonna create something

that people would hopefully enjoy and to

see the reaction that the show has

gotten has been

beyond humbling and and such a beautiful

experience and

i get to share it with two really

hilarious old guys that also use rare

beauty might i add on the show proudly

of course season two has been so much

fun the characters have evolved and

just seeing where the story takes you is

not what you expect

stay vulnerable melting blush

and nearly rose

goes a long way

only because we've created products that

are really pigmented the moments that

i've had with rare beauty come from the

tiniest things to the you know greater

scale which

means a comment that somebody will show

me from the team will make my whole day

just

hearing what people are saying about

the brand is really exciting but more

importantly with the messages and

that makes me really proud

of me and my team just because

that's what our goal was when creating a

line and then another moment was

probably when

the liquid eyeliner

went number one and i break down we

created such a beautiful precision with

the brush and having it be formed from

the calligraphy brush is just it was

really

exciting the perfect strokes universal

volumizing mascara

one of my proudest

creations

so the reason i'm

beyond proud of my mascara is because i

used to wear lash extensions i was

losing a lot of my eyelashes and

when i started to create the line and i

knew we were gonna come up with

a mascara i was like okay well i'm going

to stop getting lash extensions and i'm

going to really try to find the right

mascara that will

help my lashes look full feel full

but i was also fearful of creating that

because it's a very it's like a lot of

pressure once we create the final

product it was

so exciting to not only just have my own

lashes feel like

they're

on their own little

world

i just love the reaction that other

people had as well from you know

straight down lashes curly lashes far

slashes

i felt like we were able to create a

truly universal product with the mascara

it also just like

really really

bumps up your eyes i couldn't be

like happier so very proud of that

next would be my stay vulnerable glossy

lip in

nearly rose

the challenging part was kind of setting

the tone for what rare was gonna be and

really genuinely create products that i

know

work and that i know i feel good in it's

all i ever use and it's only because i

just want to continue to make great

products that make people feel good and

that are affordable so that's

that's my little like

finish it with the always an optimus 4

about eight inches away do about two

here we go again

so i've noticed that some days i'm

better than others

but i think i'm slowly starting to get

my system

much i think happens in every case you

kind of have to

work with something to come up with a

routine that

best suits you so i'm going to start

this time

with a little bit of the always an

optimus spray

the reason why is because now

when i put my foundation on

just already pretty breathable

it will move that was one little wand by

the way

very very exciting okay

so the spray just allows it to kind of

move around

[Music]

it's always interesting because my skin

tone isn't

necessarily consistent i could be in the

sun for a few days and

be like medium light to medium and then

if i'm

in the sun for a week or two

i'm pretty tan and then i can be really

pale so

we're talking about having a system with

like this is when i'm pale

this is when i'm light to medium and

this is when i'm tan

another thing i like to do

has put on my lip moisturizer that's

clear

and i'm gonna grab that for a second but

i

i do that and let it soak while i'm

doing my makeup

okay

it goes on like butter

now i'm going to move on to

i get redness all over my nose

that's just kind of like

something i've always struggled with

or just something i have so

[Music]

and here is my farmhouse

of three dogs

[Music]

now i will be using

my blush this one is called grace

it's one of my favorites because it's

not it's not overpowering it seems to be

a really warm

color

[Music]

now i'm going to do

a highlighter

this is a pretty like light dusty pink

one

it's called enchant it's so creepy

back to the dot system

i used two of the brushes so

that one can be blush

lighter whatever and then strictly

foundation

and other stuff so

so today i will be using

a lip color called ascend

it's really really pretty but because

i'm doing such a bright lip i'm going to

keep my eyes very

bare before we do that i'm going to make

sure the brows are good

this is something i've not gotten down

yet

oops

[Music]

ready off we go

i feel like the word rare eliminates all

of

the perfectness it's such a beautiful

word especially applying it to people

it's basically saying you're authentic

you're rare

to me

it's a brand that really is all about

accepting who you are and loving who you

are however you love however you look

but today in honor of mental health

awareness month and to kick off our your

words matter campaign we wanted to bring

some of these incredible experts to all

of you

your words matter is rare impact's

educational campaign to guide you on how

to talk about share and respond when

talking about mental health you'll learn

more about this today and as you follow

along our social channels throughout the

month

joining me to share more of this

campaign i am so excited to introduce

you to our rare beauty mental health

council member and campaign partner

tremaine elemine

tremaine runs on chai tea she's a

well-being and health equity strategist

and proudly serves as a member of the

rare beauty mental health council

as the client experience officer for

mental health first aid usa a public

mental health training program of the

national council for mental well-being

she has contributed to more than 2.5

million individuals being equipped to

recognize signs and symptoms related to

mental health substance use and suicide

across the country including training

our very own rare beauty team

tremaine thank you so much to you and

the team at mental health first aid for

being a partner in this campaign we are

so grateful to launch your words matter

with you and shed light on how the words

we use

especially when talking about mental

health have more power than we may

realize

whether we're speaking or responding

it's so important to be mindful of word

choice

and i know day in and day out you teach

so many people about this through your

work and your trainings can you start by

sharing with everyone a little bit about

the purpose behind this campaign why is

word choice so important when it comes

to mental health

well listen elise first of all thank you

you are more than welcome we're so

honored just to be a part of this um

first of all i saw people joining from

all over the world um and so excited

about the work that rare beauty and rare

impact are doing um and what i would say

about this campaign it is it's more like

an invitation really it's uh we're

inviting people to slow down we're

inviting people to be intentional um to

understand that what we say has power

just like what we do

and especially when it comes to mental

health your the campaign the your words

matter campaign um is really about

i think at least ensuring that we choose

our words carefully as we talk about

mental well-being but it's also about

sharing that our small changes the

little things that we do small

adjustments in our conversations can

create so much room for someone to say

what's really happening for them or for

us to catch up to ourselves uh and be

more willing to acknowledge our own

state of mental well-being and then talk

about these topics that for so long for

too long have been so taboo in our

communities

i love that thank you and we talked and

a lot of the resources that we created

together um

they talk about a couple things it talks

about

person-first language it also talks

about

you know what are what are some common

ways in which the context for certain

words

really matters i think there's there's

sort of two different things we've been

talking about a lot in the development

of this campaign how no one's defined by

their illness and a simple change in

language

can help us destigmatize mental health

around that piece and then this second

piece around

how we've started to normalize throwing

around words that are actually clinical

terminology and they really contribute

to increasing stigma can you talk a

little bit in more detail about

person first language and also

how we've normalized as a society and

how we really need to think a little bit

more intentionally about the way we

throw around words that are actually

clinical words that can hurt someone

yeah i think one of the things that i

love about what we've been able to

discuss and to create is this

opportunity to think about what are we

saying day to day right if we think

about um i always use the example you

know sometimes we might say things like

oh this weather is so bipolar

um or use another clinical term in ways

that don't really support a community

or individuals in our community and

being their full selves and being able

and comfortable to talk about the

challenges they really are facing so

when we exaggerate by using these

clinical terms we may be well-meaning

and have you know this opportunity to

have more color colorful language but if

we aren't using those terms in ways that

support um rather than harm then we can

do damage and unknowingly and so i think

um that's part of what we train in

mental health mental health first aid um

is to make sure that people know which

words to use and then when to use them i

think both of those are critically

important i love that so we and we talk

a little bit about um and i know you do

in mental health first aid how to

recognize or listen to someone's story

and respond and

you know if we're hearing someone misuse

a word what what is the way to kindly

sort of

respond and help i think everybody here

today wants to be part of

okay we can be mindful and really work

on our own conversations and our own

words but how do we also influence

others when we're hearing stories or

we're hearing things be thrown around

and we actually want to contribute to

educating even more people what is the

what's really the right way to respond

and to and to help influence so many

people here have

large platforms or even if we're talking

to a friend or family member um you know

the impact is just the same

yeah yeah i think um i love that you

said you know impact because that's what

it really is about um and as i think

about it it's about where that

foundation is and so at national council

for mental well-being we really uh look

at mental well-being as thriving

regardless of a mental health or

substance use challenge and so helping

folks uh to choose their words is what

we do uh as you mentioned through mental

health first aid but i think also one of

the

opportunities we have is to do so with

kindness that's another word that stuck

out to me that you said um

we don't have to

have to

um

call people out

um in in a way that is not helpful and

so one of the things that you know we're

all influencers in some way in our own

spaces and circles right um and so just

our adjustments on a day-to-day basis if

you think about it um asking someone you

know how can i support you um creating

the conversation and the space for those

conversations to happen um i've been

guilty of it you know i talk fast at

least you know that oh when i get guilty

of it

and so i've been guilty of getting

really excited if i'm talking about

well-being or community impact or equity

and inclusion like those are my subjects

oh and carbs carbs is not we know you

love carbs we know you love this

conversation

so and so i've been guilty of

my my head going slower than my mouth

and you know wanting to take those words

back and sometimes the damage has been

done so it's really really important um

that we look at this as a journey and

not a destination just like the recovery

journey we're on a road together of

learning and so it's really important

that we keep that in mind

i love that you said we're on this

journey and kind of all about being

mindful and thinking i know that later

in this conversation when jay shetty

joins us

um

i know he has some of these guidelines

for what you think about before you

speak

um

that i think will be really really

valuable to this conversation um so i

love that you said that um well i i want

to thank you so so much for helping us

kick this off

i am going to turn it over to you for

our next session which i'm so excited

for

um and i will see you all in a little

bit

thank you so so much elise um i'm

excited it's always a pleasure to talk

to you and i was so energized by our

discussion so thank you

so

really looking forward to our next

conversation y'all uh so excited that

you're all here and joining us and i'm

excited to bring up three incredible

speakers for our ask and expert panel

we get to hear directly from mental

health experts uh the first two of which

are mental uh our rare beauty mental

health council members and we'll learn

ways to share about our own mental

health stories as well as destigmatize

conversations around mental health

today we are joined by dr jessica gold

psychiatrist professor and director in

the department of psychology at

washington university school of medicine

we're also with us is dr mark brackett

founder and director of the yale center

for emotional intelligence

and author of permission to feel

and we're thrilled to be joined by sahaj

kohli speaker writer and founder of

brown girl therapy

please welcome our esteemed panelists we

can't wait to get started i'll go ahead

and give them some claps and everything

in the chat

uh welcome welcome welcome to you all

hello

thanks for being here

thank you

so today as elise and i were discussing

we're learning how much our words matter

right especially when it comes to our

mental health each of you works with a

variety of people across age identity

culture

and backgrounds

so why are words so important to mental

health this first question by the way is

open to everyone so it'll be great if

you share a little bit more about

yourself with the community that's

gathered with us today as well

who wants to start

i'm trying to be a gentleman here i was

letting sahaja yoga but i'm failing

i am really excited to be here so my

name is sahajkoli i am the founder of

brown girl therapy which is the first

and largest mental health community for

children of immigrants living in the

west um i am about to finish my master's

degree so i have been working as a

therapist in training i'm also a former

journalist i worked in journalism for

about seven years so my passion lies at

the intersection of narrative

storytelling and mental health and so as

a former journalist as a now therapist

i practice as a narrative therapist and

i really do value the words that we use

and the words that my clients use to

talk about themselves i think for for my

population i work with children of

immigrants and immigrants often the

people i work with are straddling two

very different cultures to very

different norms to very different value

systems and so it can be really

difficult to feel like you're getting

all of these externalized messages and

those develop into these internalized

messages and stories that we tell about

ourselves often what i see is these

stories are peppered with shame with

self-blame and so it's really important

for us to interject kindness and

compassion in the way that we talk about

ourselves the ways that we talk about

mental health and the ways that we talk

about other people

as small as it seems like you were

saying in the introduction it really can

make such a significant impact on our

mental health and the ways that we feel

a sense of belonging in our

relationships and in the systems we live

in

dr jessica gold go ahead okay hey um so

i'm i'm jesse gold i'm a psychiatrist

for those who don't know because i think

it's kind of confusing that means i went

to medical school and can prescribe

psychiatric medicine

i also primarily in my clinic see

college students and health care workers

and also am a writer too i did it the

opposite way though where i went to the

medical path first and then started

writing

i think words are really important

because it's hard to get people to want

to ask for help anyway and so if the

words make them feel for some reason

that there's something wrong with them

for asking for help or they have a

weakness for asking for help or whatever

label that puts on them in their

communities if they already have that

why would they want to ask for help so i

think the words we use can make it

easier for people to feel comfortable

actually just saying like something's

wrong like i need to talk to someone and

i think that's really important

absolutely absolutely and rounding us

out yeah thank you

so um

for me you know it's funny when i was

listening to your introduction i all i

did was regress back to my childhood

um because um

none of you know me but my my day job is

i'm a professor of psychology at yale um

and my other job is i run around the

world trying to get people to talk about

their feelings

and what i find

is that most people just don't have the

language they don't have the words to

communicate clearly i'm fine i'm okay

i'm busy

but really how are you feeling and just

briefly you know i was um i grew up in

new jersey and i had a pretty tough

childhood um

meaning that uh i was abused as a kid

and uh

i had two parents who loved me but they

didn't really know

anything about emotional intelligence

uh however i was blessed believe it or

not by an uncle who was building a

program to teach children

emotional illiteracy

and when i was 11 years old i had an

uncle who was sitting with me in the

backyard

and he looked at me and he just said

mark

how are you feeling

but really how are you feeling

and it was that moment

that everything was able to come out and

he wasn't judging me for what i was

sharing he didn't say you know

i can't handle it or toughen up

it was all about listening

being compassionate

and honestly it started my whole career

as a psychologist and what i've learned

is that

most people just don't have the words

and so my career has been uh supporting

people and building their emotional

vocabulary and then learning the

strategies to help them manage the full

range of emotions

okay mark so

just saying um that's powerful and so so

incredibly helpful in helping us

understand

you know

why you're in this field unknowing your

why right and i think that's incredibly

powerful and important i think all of us

have that we have this reason we do what

we do and what we're motivated by um

could you continue to talk to us about

that um

a little bit your work at the yale

center for emotional intelligence um in

your book permission to feel really do

give people that deeper insight into the

world of social and emotional

understanding and so um that embracing

of feelings uh you're the emotion

scientist i saw so

as the emotion scientists on our panel

today could you share a few things that

we should consider as we approach these

conversations um

about mental health either in school or

at work or in our communities you know

with co-workers colleagues uh those the

relationships are different so can you

give us some perspective and a few

things that we should consider we have a

whole day for this right right i mean

it's only two minutes but

like figuring this out but um you know

the first thing is i just want to say up

front

that

none of us is born with this knowledge

or this skill

you know there's no air of our brain

that has like emotion language and

evidence-based strategies to help us

regulate our feelings

i didn't know that was until i was in

graduate school to be honest with you

and so we need to just make these

concepts available as early as possible

that means the parents or giving birth

to children and raising children the

teachers who are you know raising kids

in a different way communities

and with that said

um i think the first step

is giving ourselves the permission to

feel

and so you know going back to my own

story the abuser in my situation

threatened me i was silenced

and so imagine what it's like for a

five-year-old or a six-year-old or a 15

or 20 or 40 year old

to be un you know restricted

in articulating their experience

it's awful because it leads to

suppression repression

depression the list goes on

and

so for me that's the first step and then

the question is well who are these

people

and what i found in my research is that

there's three core characteristics plus

many others

they show empathy

they have compassion

and they are non-judgmental

and so those are kind of the core

characteristics of these people in our

lives and then you know it moves on to

being curious as opposed to critical

about emotions getting that language

right

so ruler is the framework that i use

which is recognizing emotions

understanding their causes and

consequences

labeling them with precise words

being comfortable expressing those

feelings which takes discernment by the

way because when i when i ask you how

are you feeling you have to trust me

yeah you're gonna you're gonna i'm gonna

listen and be there for you and then

finally you know the strategies that

help us to regulate our feelings and

we're finding that this is where people

really fall short people just haven't

learned and practiced

really

helpful strategies i'll stop there

yeah yeah i mean i think all of those

are so critical all of those strategies

and knowing what to do

it just ties in so much to what we

talked about earlier and the skills and

things that we can learn by doing

trainings etc uh and we do that and you

mentioned uh mark that that was

in um

you were you were experiencing that or

getting aware of those words in graduate

school

and jesse you work with college students

um and so uh i think it would be great

to hear from you i know you work with

college students and health care

professionals that support youth and

young adults and so that perspective

there's often a you know significant

stress that is happening during that

time um but how can we recognize and

really support someone who might be

experiencing a mental health crisis

situation right and not just naming

those feelings but they might be in a

crisis or if maybe it's me and i know

i'm struggling but i don't know where to

turn where to go first um

how do we use our words to really deal

with crisis situations

absolutely so thanks for asking the

question and also thank you mark for

sharing i think it's really hard to

share something like that in front of

people especially honestly as a

professional in the field so thank you

for doing that um you know i think when

i think about how you know you're in

crisis versus not i think it's hard to

exactly give you a definition or say

like this is how you know at this moment

that you need help but i think a lot of

what it has to do is change over time

and how long it's been so if you've been

struggling with your mood like you know

identifying your feelings like mark said

and you repeatedly feel sad and it's

been a while meaning not a week but

weeks or it's changed and it's gotten

worse so you're feeling sadder as an

example i think that is a good way to

kind of know that something's more

severe or that you're more in need of

seeing someone like

anyone on this panel for you know mental

health help or you know me which would

be kind of a bit further along depending

on need for medicine but i think you

know when you're talking to someone

about their struggles and what they're

going through i think the most important

thing is just to be there for them so i

think people really want to give advice

and really want to say

well when this happened to me i did this

so that can be helpful but sometimes

people just want you to listen and

sometimes people have never said

anything to anyone before like this is

the first time they've ever told someone

they're struggling but they are really

struggling right and so being there for

somebody and just listening is a big

thing and you can often say something

like would it be helpful if i gave you

advice afterwards and actually using our

words to make sure that we're not giving

someone something that they don't want

or that would feel invalidating in a way

to them so would it be helpful if i

helped you one of the ways i think it's

most helpful for people when you're the

friend or the family member is it's

really hard to make phone calls and ask

for help right like we basically say

you're feeling you're struggling call

all these people when you're sad and

have no energy or you're anxious and

don't want to pick up the phone and talk

to people right so if your friend is

struggling one of the things that is a

good thing to offer if you can would be

would be helpful for me to call some of

those people with you or call some of

those people for you so it's not such a

big burden and so i'm here for you and

you know that you asked for help and you

can actually find it yeah yeah asking

for help and actually find it right

that's such a key component of that

jesse um sahaj you are helping people

find that help

and then your training to help people

help get help uh which uh thank you and

shout out to all those that are doing

the work in communities but also hopeful

that you're taking care of yourselves

because it's such a need right now um

professional help is available and

needed but it's not always available or

needed right and so we need some of the

helpers to be in this other space and

we need that help to be culturally

relevant um and so uh sahaj in your work

with brown girl therapy um you really

highlight and address the unique

experience as you mentioned of children

uh of individuals who've immigrated from

another country what can you really

uh if you had to in a sound bite um

because you could we can do a whole

presentation y'all just the four of us

for three days i i kid you not it could

happen um so

if you could tell us what are the things

that we can do at the start of a mental

health journey especially for those who

might have the lived experience of being

um a child of an immigrant um especially

for those who maybe don't know what to

say or where to start based on um

what they their cultural experience and

what brings them to where they are

yeah i i definitely do do presentations

on this so i'm going to try to keep this

short because i can talk about this

forever

i will say uh you know i myself as a

child of immigrants i am the first in my

family to be born in the west i am the

first in my family to seek therapy speak

about my mental health openly i am the

first in my family to marry outside of

race religion culture so i understand

what it's like to be the first in your

family navigating these systems and

these different these differing systems

and trying to figure out what it means

to feel a sense of belonging and

acceptance amongst all the people that

you surround yourself with including

your family and your friends and the

people you're socialized with

um when you know over a decade ago i did

experience something traumatic myself

and when i was living at home at the

time i really needed to seek a therapist

and it was the first time my immigrant

parents had ever even heard the words

mental health they had been living in

the country for about 20 years um i had

been born here i had been raised here

but it was the first time that they even

understood what therapy was my dad is a

physician he understands what

psychiatrists do but he didn't

understand that you would just go see a

therapist to talk about your mental

health without it really needing to mean

that something is quote unquote wrong

with you and so i had to first hand

navigate this cross-cultural

communication with them my parents were

taking my struggles my um hurt as

something a reflection of them that they

failed me as their as my as my parents

when in reality they didn't right we can

only protect the people we love as much

as we can we can't protect people beyond

what they will experience out there in

the world and so i had to navigate this

cross-cultural communication where you

know in the western world in in the

world the systems i'm socialized in

we're very explicit and direct and you

know we have paper trails we are very um

communicative in a lot of ways through

our words whereas in the culture i was

born into and raised with at home we're

very implicit we use non-verbal we don't

really ask explicitly we make

assumptions and so i had to navigate

this the situation where i felt like i

almost had to prove what i was going

through and the struggle i was feeling

and i think that was the first step for

me for realizing how important language

is but also how important it is to kind

of even be able to identify what we're

feeling like mark was saying even having

the wherewithal and the language and the

knowledge the emotional knowledge to say

i'm sad i'm hurt i'm struggling that was

not something my parents had the

privilege to ever be able to explore as

immigrants they moved here

you know not with a lot of money or

resources i i definitely have more

research resources than they do and i

see that a lot with children of

immigrants it's something i like to call

as thrivers guilt this idea that we feel

guilty because we have access to so many

more resources and opportunities than

our parents had and so we feel almost

ashamed and guilty for trying to

self-actualize we're trying to reach out

for help

when in reality that is you know it's a

privilege it's also a burden but it's

something that we deserve

and so beyond thriver's guilt i also see

the concept of gratitude shame or toxic

positivity spiritual bypassing this idea

that we should feel ashamed for

struggling because maybe our immigrant

parents or our ancestors who lived

through colonialism and war and poverty

had it worse so therefore there's this

binary thinking that oh since they went

through x y and z i can't struggle i

have so much privilege compared to get

them so i should just just be grateful i

should just suck it up i should just put

my head down when in reality pain and

suffering are not a competition both

things can be true at the same time our

parents can have their own struggles our

friends can have their own struggles and

we can have our own struggles you can

appreciate and respect what your parents

have done for you and you can wish that

they had done more or that they had

resources to understand your struggles

better so finding community and and safe

and psychologically and emotionally safe

relationships is key right so you can do

this through your friends if it's not

your family it might be friends it might

be social media platforms like brown

girl therapy i mean i created this

platform

out of selfish reasons first and

foremost and then it grew into something

much greater for people to be able to

connect with one another and see

themselves um kind of reflected in the

mental health content it's really hard

to feel like you deserve quality care

when the care isn't speaking to your

struggles and so really trying to find

that community is is the number one key

to feeling less alone and being able to

ask for the help that you might need

yeah yeah you said so much um and two of

the things that i think really first of

all folks in the chat are going in and

really excited about all the things um

that all of you have been sharing and um

we're going to give an opportunity so

make sure you're submitting those

questions uh because we will give an

opportunity for us to have that dialogue

um directly with our panelists uh

one of two of the things that all of you

are really have tied into um sahaj from

a creating a platform standpoint um

jessie from the population that you're

focused on and who you're supporting and

mark um your your engagement with young

people as well uh there

are some exchanges that are happening

digitally when it comes to these words

right

if you think about these spaces and

that's one of the things that i love

about rare impact and their beauty and

the creation of this community where it

really is a community it really is uh

coming and being connected and not

feeling oh you know that is real right

so so with everyone on social media with

everything that's happening um

do you have any strategies specific or

let's choose one let's choose one

strategy specifically if you had to

choose one strategy um for coping with

the pressures of social media because we

have those positives of community

building but the pressures of social

media if you had to choose just one

thing uh to share um and navigating that

and you know i think somehow you're

you're navigating that role model kind

of you know peace and title well having

your own struggles right just

jesse as well um you know how do we do

that uh and deal with and what's that

one strategy that's your go-to

i keep saying one

because we don't have a lot of time but

you all are amazing and i want to make

sure people have one and we can get to

some of their questions uh so let's see

uh mark let's start with you

i'll tell you my one strategy which is i

limit how much time i spend on it

because i have addictive qualities to my

150,Sephora,Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton's Beautiful & Inclusive Founder Story | Sephora,"i was born on the wonderful island of

jamaica

my formative years were there and i did

not realize i was poor

i wanted to have people see that you

know someone who looks like me

who came from where i came from could

create something

that is now available to the whole world

everything is possible

i'm dr rosemary engleton and i'm the

founder of rose ingleton

md skincare truthfully i'm a unicorn in

this space

i'm a dermatologist with over 20 years

of experience

i created my skincare line for my

patients

i was inspired by them the products are

for

everyone i wanted it to appeal to men

women older younger folk

when i created my line my dream was

always

to end up at sephora anything that came

before that was building to that

and then sephora found me it was amazing

our ethos are so aligned so to be

finally a part of the sephora family

being on sephora.com is absolutely

the answering of a dream

[Music]

i can't tell you how much my parents

constant support

has been what made me really thrive

my family always had a lot of fruit

around the house and

it wasn't until after my training really

when i realized that a lot of the fruit

products that we were ingesting

had skin benefits

my mother she was always meticulous

about cleansing her skin

she was using the things we had around

the home

granules from the kitchen that would

give her the benefit of an exfoliation

what i did learn from her was the

importance of

cleaning your skin

i first created a moisturizer

it has all of the great stuff in there

that i thought you need for

just basic good skin health that's

totally separate from my jamaican

superfruit blend which is what makes my

products

special that is my secret sauce and

that's what ties back to my heritage

all the fruit extracts that i put in

there and the hyaluronic acid and all of

that

that's what makes it stand apart i

definitely focused on making sure that

the products

were being cleanly sourced

the product is literally vegan

[Music]

i wanted to be able to reach as many

people from as many backgrounds as

possible

and to show inclusivity in my product

line and now

being a part of sephora showing

inclusivity in the representation of

brands on their shelves

is a really perfect union

151,Sephora,How Jessi Overcame Adversity to Pursue Her Dreams | Sephora,"the unique thing about me being a makeup

artist is the way that I actually apply

cosmetics so I have limited use of both

of my arms due to a physical disability

called arthrogryposis so I actually

taught myself how to apply cosmetics

using my mouth

[Music]

my name is Jesse and I'm a professional

makeup artist I am fully self-taught my

clients come from all walks of life and

a lot of people specifically come to me

just for the experience I've gotten so

many amazing reviews that it's almost

like a facial massage growing up with

Jesse in middle school I noticed she was

just a tomboy I was hanging around with

the guys just cool break and she come

back looking real pretty with the

mascara stuff I was I hold up I gotta

take another look at what's up and 69

extra to go to prom and then ever since

that we've been together for 15 years my

life is as normal as anybody else's we

get up drink coffee feed our animals our

fur babies love that have fun going out

places like everyone else

to the Sephora store I'd read it and I'm

happy at it cuz we get to try a lot of

different cool stuff but then the wallet

cries people they look at us with some

type of like repulsion they don't think

we can actually like being a

relationship together it'll be too hard

but we challenge that all the time he

gets me trust every single day he'll

help me put lashes on she loves me when

I do too but I love helping her and

doing everything and just it's my family

she's my wife

[Music]

I thought the industry would shun me you

know I was denied my education for

cosmetology one school that I went to

shredded my application in front of me

they told me that it was unsanitary and

that it was unethical that made me feel

like the gum on somebody's shoe

so I had my very first opportunity to do

makeup which was a fashion show and I

never told them how I applied cosmetics

and I was so scared

models were kind of you know standoffish

because it's that stereotype you know

she's gonna poke me in the eye oh you

know she's gonna drool on me and the

first model that sat in my chair she's

like I'm ready do you need me to help

you open anything she was just so

welcoming that was the fuel that I

needed the second day I had 23 models

lined up wanting to experience this and

wanting to go onto the runway with

makeup that I put on

there were so many people that told me I

would never be where I am and thinking

back to where I started and where I came

from it was all worth

i think makeup for me

has just been life-changing my mom has

always been

super glamorous when i was little she's

having me like put on her lipstick for

her

this has always been my normal so for me

like when i grew up i was like i want

makeup but i

suppress that forever and then when i

got my first makeup then it was like all

right well we've already put our

toe in the water like swim in the pond

[Music]

my name is patrick and i am the stage

experience lead at sephora

growing up in a smaller town i was

afraid to be who i was

i was afraid to wear what i wanted

one time i had done like more than

normal for school

and i had makeup on and i came home that

day and i had wiped it off because

people were judging me

and my mom asked me why did you take

everything off

i saw the way you looked at yourself

when you left and i don't know what

changed in between

when i was in the 10th grade i told five

friends that i was gay

by lunchtime a girl announced to the

whole cafeteria that i was gay

and i went to the bathroom and i just

cried and let it out and then i went

home for the day

i don't know what happened i don't know

if a spirit entered me but like that

night i like made a change

people are gonna tear me down my whole

life and tell me that there's things

wrong with me and there isn't

[Music]

i've been at sephora for seven years i

started right out of high school

one day i was in my mall and i went into

the sephora and i had

full makeup on i'll never forget the

woman behind the counter

came up to me and was like hi you have a

job

[Music]

[Applause]

i love working there because i work with

really diverse people

and i think that sephora is really

getting behind

movements and really supporting their

people and changing people's lives

it's super important that we change the

conversation about makeup because

makeup has always been genderless my

gender identity is gender non-binary

and my preferred pronouns are they them

i created a drag persona named christina

i needed someone who was unapologetic

and someone who wasn't afraid to be

themselves

when i throw on the wig or i throw on

lashes there's like a little bend in my

neck

and i just become more confident and i

think that christina's whole message is

to be kind

and be nice to people christina showed

up for me

so that i could show up for other people

[Music]

if i could talk to my 11 year old self i

would have

a long conversation i would be like get

comfortable it's okay that i

felt different then and that i felt

strange

and that i felt like a freak because

i don't feel like a freak anymore

[Music]

i think if i could have the world know a

couple things about me i would tell them

this isn't a phase we just want to exist

and be happy and have people just accept

us for who we are

the inevitable goal is that we would all

live in a place where we just loved each

other for who we are regardless of who

we are

154,Sephora,Tamara's Story of Belonging: Be Yourself for Yourself | Sephora,"I was born with a condition called

osteogenesis imperfecta it's a genetic

disease and it caused my bromas to be

very brittle I will break frequently

like people attacked me and I will break

by age 18 I broke over 200 times growing

up I never saw anyone that looked like

me on any platform I do run into adults

sometimes older than me that look at me

like I'm strange or just kind of be rude

and that's kind of just comes with the

territory and you get used to it

unfortunately I try not to let it down

for me because it just happened so much

that if you did I feel like I just

wouldn't be in a good place mentally

when I graduated from college I actually

was having a really hard time getting

hired from companies whether it be

because of the world share cuz the

places were inaccessible with some

people as soon as accessible is not

always really accessible that's one of

the challenges you face because the

world unfortunately is not made for

wheelchairs my mom I do remember always

said is it's important to kind of know

yourself for yourself and this is not

just in the physical aspect it's all

aspects like when I look in the mirror I

have to be happy about who I see as long

as I'm happy who I see when I go out in

the world it didn't really matter what

someone says but someone does because I

Know Who I am beauty comes in so many

different forms I want everybody to

understand there's always some beauty

aspect to you

the first time I ever went into sofware

was at age 12 I'm gonna play with

everything that's in the store and

figure out like what your makeup look is

gonna be it's kind of like you just went

into this little fantasy world in a way

that's one of the reasons why I love

Sephora and I do love being able to play

with the perfumes though different

colors it's just a bigger ating I guess

is the right word to describe a family I

do try to find that one makeup product

that will make my makeup kind of pop

like today I'm wearing eyeliner to kind

of showcase another ideal beauty that

maybe other people didn't see even

though I didn't have that I want to be

that for someone else

I thought a lot of people would be very

surprised that I do so many things

independently I live on my own I Drive

on my own I own the business I always

had a love for 13 but I didn't really

twisted into an actual business until I

went to college and I discovered like

there's people I actually don't know how

to thrift that's what kind of birthed

golden rags it just started as a hobby

turned into a love turned into a

business I just was my organic self to

get here I didn't have to change who I

was how it looked what I did you can be

you and still get where you need to be I

latina business owner

[Music]

at 12 i picked up my mom's eyebrow

pencil and it gave me a lot of

confidence

and when i was in high school it's when

i found my passion for makeup

the first time i walked into sephora i

was 14 and

as soon as i walked in i fell in love

with the store any product that you're

looking for

they're gonna have it when i was in

beauty school i started learning more

techniques

and i had more clients and i knew that

that was for me

i knew that that's what i wanted and i

started my own business

i love my clients i'm able to provide

them with a full service

and i also give them makeup classes

[Music]

i was born in michoacan mexico i was

eight when i moved to the united states

my mom and my dad decided to move from

mexico to the u.s

because in mexico there's a lot of

poverty they knew that they were not

going to be able to give us

the same future we have now when we got

here we moved to

my aunt's house and then from there we

got our own little studio with my family

so my mom my dad me and my two sisters

it was hard for my family because i saw

my parents struggle a lot

[Music]

my mom would wake up at four in the

morning and they had to be

in the fields by 6 am it was very hard

for them because they had to be in the

sun

all day working a 12-hour shift and

my dad would get home at six and have to

go to his second job at 8 pm

and then from that he would get home

like at 3 a.m and

he would sleep a couple hours and he

would wake up and do the same routine

all over again it was very hard because

we weren't able to see him

they were times where

they could barely pay for a rent so

that was the only thing they were able

to afford at that time

people sometimes have a stereotype of

undocumented people that we

are lazy that we don't work that we come

here to take

their jobs away that we don't contribute

to the society

the truth is that we are very

hardworking people

a lot of field workers are the reason

that many people

have food on their table i'm in the

process of becoming a us citizen

and i know that this will open a lot of

doors for me my parents sacrificed so

much for me

i have to give something back to them so

that's my motivation for me to keep

going

it's very important for me to tell

people my story

because i know there's a lot of

undocumented people out there

if you want something in life you have

to work very hard for it

but you will get through it and

everything's possible you just have to

keep

faith and be strong

you

i was born with a bilateral cleft

lip and palette my upper lip

and my palate were not formed when i was

born

kids would call me names and they would

just

sometimes like come over to me and just

tell me you're so

ugly

my navajo plan is yucca fruit strung out

on a lion clan

i grew up in mesa arizona which wasn't

predominantly native american

and at times i felt different

as being not just the only native kid

but also having a bilateral cleft lip

as i got older and became

more apparent that i was being bullied

kids would call me names like rhinoceros

nose and

oh my and i realized i was gonna

[Music]

when i didn't feel like i belonged my

family was always there to

tell me that i was loved that i was

beautiful

skateboarding helped me definitely

escape from what others said

and i could just ride for hours

with skateboarding there are no bounds

to what you can or can't do

i had to go through numerous surgeries

to fix my

lip but now if you look at me today you

can't tell

the first time i went into sephora it

definitely helped me

feel confident because

my scars are on my face makeup can put

the focus

on my eyes it's about having fun

seeing how big i can make my eyeliner

wing

and it makes me feel all the more

powerful

regardless of what anyone says

i know that i'm beautiful

as a modern-day navajo person we always

referred to

coming back to the reservation as coming

home

we decided to move back and

i remember being so thrilled to just

live freely where i live on the

reservation

there is no running water no internet

connection and some people don't have

electricity

my typical day starts with feeding the

animals

my grandma has always told me that if i

take care of them they'll take care of

me

the sheep they provide me my wool for my

weaving

from that i make rugs and i also

make purses i really

have a deep admiration for rug weaving

because something that's been in my

family for seven generations

my favorite navajo thing is

it means life is what you make it

regardless of any struggles that we face

as navajo people we are all empowered

we are creative and we are strong

with pansexual they don't know what it

means and in their brains either you're

gay or you're straight

um my parents

didn't grasp it and

it was not something that they wanted

their daughter to be

i'm erica and i'm the communications

lead for sephora prism

our business employee resource group and

i support all things

lgbtqia plus related

it's important to have a group in our

business because it gives us all a sense

of belonging

especially anybody who identifies as

lgbtqia plus but also for allies

i identify as pansexual i define

pansexual as

somebody who loves everybody not

necessarily a specific gender i don't

care who you are

and what you identify as if you're a

wonderful person i will love you

i always knew in my heart that i was

just open to anything and everything and

i didn't know

what type of capacity that really meant

i grew up in western new york and the

city that i

lived in there weren't a lot of people

like me growing up

at least that were out and proud of that

so coming out was very difficult my

parents were not

accepting in the beginning at all that

was very tough because i did grow up as

a daddy's girl

and my mom she's my best friend but

it felt different so

i didn't really talk to my parents i

kind of

backed away and reverted into my shell a

little bit

and that was really difficult

i started sephora back in 2012 as a

part-time cashier

once i stepped into the sephora space

that was the moment where i felt the

most authentic and the most myself

i always felt like i had to work extra

hard

to be erica but i found out that you

don't have to work extra hard

when you know you belong somewhere

everybody feels like family and

i really do feel like we're kind of all

cut from the same cloth in a sense

even though we're all very different we

all still have the same core values

that's where i really fell in love with

the company shortly after that

there was an open role at corporate

headquarters

and i got my dream job

now i am unapologetically myself to show

other people that you can be who you are

and that is 100

more than okay when i go back home my

family is very close

and that feels incredible

when i look in the mirror

i see somebody who has

overcome a lot i see somebody who is

strong

working on her confidence and also

somebody that has found her place

i can finally be proud of who i am

ted during christmas i had one last gift

to get for the girls and so i thought

makeup would be fun of course they was

excited about it and braley she just

said well daddy can i put makeup on you

my dad has a good face for me

i'm brad i'm chloe and braylee's dad and

some people know me as makeup dad

i'm a supervisor for a trucking company

so i have to turn it on i have to be

manly man you know at work but once i

clock out and i get around my girls my

daughter's got me wrapped around their

finger you know and but i wouldn't have

it no other way

chloe's real chill i mean she's real

cool calm and collected braylee is the

happy-go-lucky one she's always smiling

she got this little giggly laugh that

you know people just fall in love with

and they both love makeup we went into

sephora they loved the lip gloss all the

makeup palettes and talking to like the

workers they were really pretty and

they're really nice

yeah the employees that so far were

great one was showing braley you know

how to apply the blush and where to put

the blush on your cheek not only not on

my forehead

chloe is actually

really really good i'd say bray is like

a abstract artist though

when i posted the picture on social

media you know i was just having fun it

was more like

i can't believe i did

he wouldn't this because he is kind of

the best at ever

you know i was okay with it but when it

got to

five thousand ten thousand and six

hundred thousand i couldn't you know i

couldn't believe it

i started to see a lot of other men say

hey you know i did this with my daughter

but

what i was more touched by is when i was

getting dms from women

and their dad may have passed away and

they said you know i brought them

memories of their dad

um

and it just made their day

and and the time that it happened you

know i felt like we was in

it's crazy time with the world shut down

and everything going on but i got the

jokes and i'm okay with i got tough skin

i'm not worried about that but

it touched people

made them

remember their dad or you know the time

that you know they did this with their

dad or wish their dad was around still

to be able to do that with them

beauty comes in all shapes and all sizes

all colors

all everything so you don't have to just

be in this box

to be considered beautiful

so i want the girls to know that they

don't have to be in a box you know

anything that they they want to do you

know they can create their own beauty

okay

159,Sephora,Stories of Belonging: Daniela (In honor of National Day of Families) - Zoom | Sephora,"[Music]

one of the biggest struggles

growing up as a documented resident was

definitely finding my own identity

without letting my status

affect who i am as a person

my name is daniela and i work at sephora

i am the senior artist so i get to

inspire and elevate others craft

i got to the us when i was nine years

old my mom

wanted to come here to give us a better

life

i remember her always working very hard

to give us everything that we needed and

what we wanted

obviously as a single mom coming in here

and starting brand new it's very hard

and something that i know that it was

not easy for her

so when we first moved here we went to

school

pretty much everything normal i think

that i started seeing the effects of

uh being undocumented resident when i

got to my teenage years

but i knew that it was something that i

couldn't really talk about

because people can be cruel sometimes

people will use things against you just

to be mean

so i knew that it was something that we

could only talk between

myself my mom and my sister

[Music]

in 2019 my mom

was denied her residency

after living here for 20 years and they

told her that there was nothing else she

could do that she had to go back

[Music]

and that was a time that was very hard

i'm getting emotional um

it was a time that was very hard for me

and my sister because like i said me and

my mom

and my sister were everywhere together

um

she was my best friend

[Music]

after she left my store director told me

that i could take as much time as i

needed for myself

and then when i went back to work i can

say that my sephora family played a huge

part

my store director was amazing she was

very very supportive and very caring

about the whole situation

and i think that being at work and

seeing how much support i was getting

not only from my family

but from my sephora family it made me

feel at ease and it made me feel like i

wasn't alone

and and because that's how i was feeling

i was feeling like i had lost part of

myself when she left

i try to talk to my mom every single day

i try to make it feel like she never

left

transitioning to a completely different

culture all over again it's been hard

for her

hopefully we'll get to see her soon we

miss her a lot and

i really want her to come back and i

know that one day

we'll be a family together again

surrounded by Nature here in Arizona we

have beautiful mountains we have a

beautiful sky view those things really

made this become the sky is the limit

collection

just finished my first meeting with

Deborah I already have an idea of what I

want the collection to look like the

name of our collection is extent and

it's a play on the theme of x

I feel like we should definitely work

with your flowers and create something

just really bold yes it's a good idea

our collection is called chasmo this one

here is almost ready and we wanted to do

it on this kimono one yes on the back

our name for this collection is

enlightened

I love all the different colors like the

Reds and the pinks and the orange they

look really really good

our collection is part animal part

Resort where so the wild ethno which is

the perfect title for the collection

the hardest part of the design process

is narrowing down some of our crazy

ideas to make sure that they're

understandable to everyone our

collaboration is named till C Street I

got some things done hopefully you like

what I have amazing

the name of our project is Sparks of

transformation and what it pretty much

represents is people coming out and

being free being free and who they are

and living in your truth it's been a lot

of different back and forth I did some

sketches as well I came up with three

girls but I wanted to make them kind of

look like aliens like with some elf ears

our collection is called GXP it's a

fantasy Motocross brand I don't think

there's any time to sleep like we

literally have two days

deadlines it's always a little bit

nerve-wracking you want this to be a

perfect collection we're almost there

but we still have work to do

the name of our collaboration is Hotel X

placement I think it's stunning together

love it so much yeah

it feels a bit surreal grateful for the

opportunity to be able to create

something and have it out there in the

world looking at these garments I am

absolutely Amazed by what we have both

created

I'm just really excited to see how other

people are going to wear them and style

them

you can see the artist you can see the

inspiration behind the prints we wanted

to make sure that that really came

through I think we together could

transform an idea that is very abstract

to something beautiful I think that's

amazing I really liked it this

happened before for over 30 years

there's there's no public art in this

so thank you very much now definitely

coming from Venezuela from the Latino

I thought it was incredible I mean not

only just the artwork the entire setup

from the food vendors to the business

vendors to all of the people this is

what Houston is all about celebrating

diversity celebrating culture and Sheen

has done a great way to highlight that

honestly I thought it was so cool like

seeing Chien take you know initiative in

the community just the fact that they're

able to be so inclusive to the community

and the culture I think Houston is so

full of culture so it's such a great way

to do it as well so I think of the event

is perfect like

and set out perfectly and then it's

crowded I love it I hope we have like

more events like this well art brings

people together right and so as we're

celebrating culture through aapi month

it brings all people from all

backgrounds together and they're able to

foremost I want to hear a little bit

about your Journeys as

a designer in this creative field tell

us a little bit about how everything got

started for you I'll start with you

Kenya

we don't have enough time

um well I am formally trained I went to

college to be a designer

um which I still owe a lot of money in

student loans

um

I am from Norfolk Virginia I went to

college

really

hey girl

that's weird

oh so I went to okay so real let me make

this real fast I was a crazy Rebel kid

in high school I wanted to be pretty I

almost didn't graduate high school I had

to go to a um I had to take either

woodwork or fashion merchandising to

graduate high school of course I took

fashion merchandising

um it was an eye-opener for me my GPA

sucked I barely got into college got

into college had too much fun in college

my mom sent me to Atlanta to go to a

technical school which was no band no

parties or nothing but I still found a

party then I got I learned how to sew

and make patterns and then after that I

thought that I was going to go to New

York and work for Donna Karen and then

the world said no I ended up being a

bartender and then I was bartending and

waiting tables and then I was making

clothes at night and then I was poor and

then my lights will go out and then I

would take the extension cord and when

everyone else asleep and I would plug it

outside of my building because they had

power and I would make clothes because

I'm like I got 800 I'm getting the gun

to buy fabric I'm gonna pay rent and

then I will still pour

and man one it was like and then I had

like this very crazy moment as an adult

when you have to move back home with Mom

and then I had to go to back to Virginia

and then they made me very sad and then

like three months into being in Virginia

um something just said apply for a

Project Runway and I'm like that's

bananas because that show that make no

sense you can't make clothes that

quickly and then I did

and then I messed up the application I

put like monkey pictures and like Mickey

Mouse and then the very next day they

called and they said we want you on the

show and I said why and then

and then they said we think you're great

but please send us some good pictures

and then I made it on the show and I

made it to the top five and then I came

home and then I was poor again and then

I was sleeping on sofas I was literally

sleeping on the floor in my studio and I

was taking showers I mean well bird

baths or whole baths whatever they call

them at the at the local grocery store

at 7 A.M and then I would come back to

my studio like I was never there because

I would sleep on the floor and then life

just kept turning but I never stopped

and I think because I didn't stop and I

kept going uh life keeps showing me all

the great things that it has to offer

okay

foreign

oh my gosh

what is story and Kenya all of that led

you here today yeah amazing thank you so

much for sharing I was here for the ride

I loved it so much and I didn't cry oh

uh of course

we gotta hear Armand tell us about your

career your journey how did you get here

today well my story is way shorter

I have to make it short so I was born

and raised in Albania and I was drawing

and sketching ever since I was five I

went to art school over there and then

my phone I found my way to Dubai I

started working in the fashion industry

as a creative director for different

brands and just because I was doing

fashion illustration on Instagram that's

where she informed me so basically I

don't have a fashion design background

but that's always been something that I

wanted to do so uh yeah I was so so

happy when she when she reached out

because I was always lacking confidence

on not being able to construct my own

designs I was like maybe I'm I cannot be

a designer

but yeah it worked out and you know here

I am so here you are today I love that

story because I feel like a lot of us

can get in our own ways sometimes or if

we absolutely absolutely don't be the

one to tell yourself no ever exactly uh

and of course Valerie we're so happy to

have you here today how did everything

come to be with your career well

um I was actually designing jewelry when

I was in first grade I got in trouble

um I got sent home because the teacher

caught me selling at recess and they're

like you can't sell at school

um so I got sent home and they told my

mom and it was a big deal and so I

couldn't sell my jewelry which I was

really sad

um when I was in third grade I kept

doing it anyways I was like I'm making

money so I am going to keep doing this I

actually bought tickets to Disneyland

when I was in third grade very proud of

myself

um

and yeah similar story to Kenya the

struggle with being a designer

um not having a traditional education

you know being self-taught you know I

took the more punk rock route where I

taught myself everything I took clothes

apart I figured it out on my own I

didn't have guidance I didn't have I

didn't really have like a support

network so in a way you know I had to

carve my own path

um and yeah here I am today you know

just keep writing and the same with you

Kenya you know don't give up you know

the the odds will be against you but you

know just keep pushing through and and

you'll shine

yes absolutely

I love that you were selling jewelry in

first grade that's an iconic story I'm

sorry for that yeah boring a young

business woman

I know you all have participated in

various activities within the she and X

program including our very first 100K

challenge which I don't know if you guys

know we get a super cool design

competition Series where we had uh

different designers mentored by some of

the biggest names in fashion including

Christian siriano uh Jenna lions and

Khloe Kardashian

it was nuts uh what I'd love to hear

from each of you is what would you say

has been the most memorable moment in

your career in the she and X Program so

far or maybe a the most memorable

campaign you've been a part of and I'll

start with you Armand

okay so she next 100K was definitely the

most memorable one because we had like a

month to create the design bring them to

life shoot them and then promote them

and do everything and I enjoyed the

process so much so that was the real

campaign that I was like okay I can I

can do this full time you know I can see

myself doing this and I was super happy

with the results I I was playing with

Prince that's where I started playing

around with Prince and I was like I was

finding my identity as a designer and I

also I was voted I got most votes from

the audience which was amazing

so seeing everybody's feedback and how

people I would see people's feedback

wearing my clothes and they would

comment on the size on the on the

material and how comfortable they are

and yeah that's that's what I wanted

actually so I was I was super happy

amazing amazing and how about you

Valerie okay so it was it was a

challenge like when they said the 100K

challenge challenge yes it was a major

challenge

um one of the most memorable events that

happened actually was

staying up till 4am with Kenya

um something had happened where one of

her pieces from the runway went missing

and she needed to sew another one the

next day and our call time was like at 8

A.M I think so I invited her to sew at

my studio and we stayed up till I would

say like 4 30 and made it happen and she

constructed the jacket we had some help

and showed up 8 A.M the next day half

asleep and yeah pushed through so that

was one of the most memorable moments

actually

was like the bonding and like all of the

contestants were helping each other so

like the comradeship you know was cool

yeah that sounds awesome I love when

like when it comes to it and you got to

work together and you got to make

something happen you you surprise

yourself sometimes with what you can

accomplish yeah absolutely and Kenya

tell us memorable moment campaign

well first of all thank you girl yes of

course

um if any of you have ever had a moment

where you had to create on a dime

and in a moment I'd be so surprised at

what I can do or where my adrenaline

level will take me but I think for me

um

they definitely robbed me of my 100K

um she and y'all owe me some money

it was it was pretty dope and uh she and

please bring it back

um it is so needed

um it will really help take Brands to

the next level please please please

bring it back

[Laughter]

um

it was adrenaline rushing to his point I

mean we had a month we had to make a

collection do a shoot for the collection

like presented again I mean come to La

um I was super psyched because Chris and

siriano was my mentor

and I got to fly to New York and meet

him and hang out with him and it was

pretty dope I'm not gonna lie the 100K

contest is intense is a hundred thousand

headaches but it was intense it was

needed it was it was everything

um it was I think we all agree it was

has to be the most

um the most memorable

um yeah

she in as his dog

I love it I think that's so great that

this was such a special moment for all

of you she stayed up to four o'clock in

the morning to help me make a jacket oh

my gosh yes Round of Applause for that

please

oh my gosh here for that listen we love

the support we love the support uh

speaking of design challenges I mean it

must be tricky coming up with ideas and

getting inspiration for pieces that

you're creating and you're all she Next

Top performers so what I would love to

hear oh yeah take the moment what I

would love to hear is what how do you

get that inspiration to keep your

collections top of mind for seeing

consumers how do you keep things fresh

I'm going to start with you Valerie

well

um I mean we've been Trend setting for a

long time we've been doing this for a

really long time

um and actually we're pretty responsible

for a lot of the trends you see in like

the mainstream Marketplace

um like the baggy style for instance

that blew up

um with Billy that was us we did like

the gender fluid oversized garments and

then that became you know a trend and

then everyone started wearing you know

like the oversized like

pieces so yeah I mean I just think that

we have a natural attack for just

knowing like what's on the Forefront

like what's going to be next so it's

usually off

off the beaten path you know it's

yeah

I know you obviously started being

creative in such a businesswoman at a

very very young age would you say this

is something that that's always come

natural for you yeah actually I mean I

was actually going to school to be a

teacher I was going to be an educator

and so I was just using fashion as like

a side hustle I was like oh it makes me

money like cool people like what I'm

wearing or oh I can make this shirt or

this necklace and I would sell it and

then you know just kept throughout my

whole life through school everywhere I

was just like oh okay I could sell these

shirts I'm making I could sell this

jewelry and so yeah it was just a part

of my journey just growing up

absolutely and Kenya how about you how

do you feel you keep the collections

fresh come up with all of these ideas

each time

I fly to L.A and buy edibles

[Laughter]

um I think I'll pay attention to well

one I pay attention to my audience and I

I'm always asking my audience what do

you like

um if I make this dress will you buy it

do you like this color and that's

important because they are the ones who

are going to buy it and so when working

with qian I'm paying attention to like

who their customer is what she like

what's trending and trying to make like

what I consider to be my classic pieces

without being super trendy because I

don't like things that like go away I

want you to buy something and be able to

wear it all the time in any season and

with your sneakers and your heels and

whatever you want

um so it just really just paying

attention and a lot of it is just

kind of a shot in the dark and you'd be

like oh they like that like okay

he's saying I love the honesty as well

because I know a lot of us were so

curious about this you know we I'm gonna

tell you I don't know how you all do it

I'm so impressed by each one of you and

so I love hearing that process and and

how you come up with these amazing

pieces

um Armand how about you so for me the

strategy I was following when it comes

to designing I never want to be limited

to only one type of woman and one type

of body type

so every time we had one of these

challenges where they designed a

three-piece collection and I want every

type of woman who goes in my site and

sees the collection to find themselves

at least in one of the pieces and I want

to design for different age groups

different bodies different skin tones

of course I follow the trends you know I

keep up with the trends and I try to

like embrace them and put them in my

designs so I guess yeah that's why it's

been working I guess yeah 100

do you feel like you've had to Pivot the

way you designed to cater she in

consumers at all and if so how do you

keep your brand identity throughout

in a way yes because I do love to

interact with people I love to hear the

feedback I love to see what's selling

more what do people like so yeah it's

it's important I mean it's important to

create and come up with amazing pieces

but in the end of the day you have to

think as a businessman as well you know

you you want your pieces to sell so you

want to give the customers what they're

asking for

absolutely Kenya how about you

do you feel like you've had to Pivot uh

your designs at all to cater to she and

customers

um

not really I think I've been able to

stay true to who I am as a brand I think

the most important part of being a

designer is staying true to who I am

it's like that fine line of staying true

to who you are but you're also working

with another brand so trying to also

stay relevant and identify what who

their customer is too but without losing

yourself it can be it can be it can be a

little weird but all I'm gonna do me I'm

gonna do me and hopefully that me doing

me is going to make sense to anybody

who's going to buy it um I am five feet

I am 242 pounds yes that's what I said

um and so it matters to me when I look

at like how to dress like a curvy body

even from desires size 0 to the 20 we

all have like that curve and I want to

make sure that I am making that curve

look as fabulous as possible

yes 100 you got to be cute girl

absolutely I love it I love it and

Valerie how about you do you feel like

you've had to Pivot at all no not at all

actually if anything I feel like it's

been really

um helpful

um because it's offering freak City LA

to a customer base at like a super

affordable price you know I do

everything Hands-On and very custom

wardrobes so if you know like the price

of fashion like it's very expensive you

know doing everything by yourself so the

fact that you know joining she and X

they're able to scale and offer your

products you know at a very affordable

price so that's been really helpful so

we haven't had to Pivot like design wise

if anything it's kind of an extension

yeah very nice I love each of your

different outlooks on this as well I

know we have a lot of creatives in the

audience today and tuning in so

something I find very helpful

um as a creative myself is you know a

lot of the times we think it's such an

easy Road it's super perfect to just get

to the success that you're at and if you

haven't any hurdles you're not going to

get over them because everyone else had

it so much easier so what I would love

to know are what are some of the biggest

struggles you have faced getting into

this career path and how have you

overcome them I'll start with you Kenya

well I could say a whole lot of things

can be hurdles I can say being a five

foot black woman is a hurdle all by

itself but I could also say that

I am one that beyond what what would be

considered a hurdle rather that is who I

am whether that is the money that I have

in my bank account I have identified

that being a fashion designer is who I

am and what my purpose is and because I

have identified that being a fashion

designer who my purpose is and I walk in

that every single day the doors are

going to open because that is the

assignment that has been put on me

now because I believe that I don't have

to go and seek this I I did not reach

out to Xi'an Xi'an has reached out to me

and that's a lot of my brand

Partnerships there's a lot of things

that I feel like when you're doing like

that thing that's yours you don't really

have to fight that hard to get it you

might have to fight a little bit hard to

sustain it but you don't have to fight

hard to get it and I think that for me

um it's kind of

you know what I'm saying like it's just

a natural flow of things I don't believe

in doors closing

um because I always feel like when

something you know what I'm saying when

something closes another one opens

I just feel like what's mine is mine

like yeah you can't you it's nothing you

can do to take it or people say well you

give away so much information I can give

you I can go live every day and let you

see everything that I'm doing but like

you're not gonna do me how I'm gonna do

me

so I don't care to share the information

with you I'm not that gate keeper that's

like oh I'm not going to tell you where

I get my linen from and my zippers you

can have it

What You Gonna Do With It

I can have it but I don't feel like

there are any things I feel like again

like what I'm going to have I'm gonna

have it but my job is to stay consistent

to keep moving to stay true to the

fashion designer that I am and

everything that I want is going to

present itself as long as I keep

traveling down my road is this fashion

designer that I am

yes

absolutely I think that's an amazing way

of looking at it I have to or you're

gonna die being a fashion design is hard

you be broke you'd be like oh my God

where I'm gonna get money from do I buy

fabric do I pay bills like if you just

it'd be decisions yeah for real yeah

all of that where's the wine

Valerie how about you what what are some

of the biggest obstacles you've had to

face

it's about all of that everything Kenya

said you know the struggle is real when

you're an independent designer with no

Capital

um it's really hard you know it might be

glamorous it might look like oh it's

something I want to pursue but it takes

a certain character you know to push

through the struggles because there's

highs and lows it's like a roller

coaster you know you'll have something

that goes viral and then you'll have

moments of you know quiet and you know

it's hard but um you got to make the

struggle look sexy you gotta you know

keep pushing and um the same thing you

know it highs and lows and um

I don't know I just think that you have

to stay true to yourself and for every

no that you get because it's difficult

you know trying to break through into an

industry that's very saturated you know

for every no there's going to be a yes

you know there might be 50 no's but

there might be 10 yeses and the same

thing if you keep doing you and you're

authentic to yourself those doors will

open and opportunities will definitely

greet you and yeah and then everything

will just move forward and push forward

but it's never going to be an easy Road

there will always be obstacles

um you just have to you know know how to

get over the bumps there's always going

to be bumps in the road and it's like no

big deal you know you know what my big

experience is

to know like it's not the no right I'm

used to the no yes but it is what

happens when I stop saying yes to myself

like what's on the other side of that

like I fought so hard to be where I am

and God knows where I'm going right so

but what if I stopped today right like I

can tell you 30 million ways to like

take 20 and what to do with it but what

I don't know is like what does that

yacht look like what does that private

island look like what does retiring my

mama look like and if I stop today I

won't know what that what that means I

don't slept girl let me tell you I slept

on the floor in my studio with my back

hurting and I had a client that's gonna

meet me there at 8 30 so I gotta clean

up go to the grocery store and take a

whole bath and then come back and act

like I just got there when she got there

like no I did all that stuff exactly so

like if I stop now like was it all in

vain

I like my own show girl when you're

talking about bird baths I had an

electric kettle that was my shower that

was my hot shower so sleeping in a

studio we slept in our showroom and

that's how we operated for the longest

time but here we are so it's never in

vain the struggle is never in vain and

you I love I'm going to steal this but

make the struggle look sexy I love that

so much uh Armand how about you

I mean everything you guys said I agree

but I also want to say the biggest

artist that ever existed you know they

always come from a dark place they all

struggle they all had like a difficult

childhood so I think that can easily

become like a source of inspiration and

a source of strength so yeah

but the struggle the biggest struggle

definitely is

um to stand out as a brand

um there's so many Brands every day

somebody is launching something new so

how do you stay relevant to to yourself

and what you do and stay unique while

still standing out and and sell in the

end of the day for me one of the biggest

challenges especially being based in the

Middle East where everything is very

restricted so sometimes that can affect

the creativity as well so you're like

stuck in a box and everything is a don't

so how do you step out of that box

create something that you're proud of

that people are going to like as well so

that has been one of the challenges for

me

thank you so much for sharing uh Armand

looking back at your career path is

there anything you would have done

differently or that you wish you could

do again

um I don't think so I think everything

happens for a reason so I think I've

learned a lot and sometimes I look at

some of my pieces I created a couple

years ago and I'm like what was I

thinking you know but at the time I

thought that was the right thing so yeah

I don't think I would have changed

anything

that's a good answer good answer I I

definitely feel you in the you know

everything happens for a reason mindset

I know how about you Kenya is there

anything looking back at your career you

would have done differently or that you

wish you could do again I would have

hired a CPA from the beginning

um don't overlook the money people they

are your friend their friend they will

help you no I don't think I would change

anything I think that every struggle

hurdle exciting moment sad moment

fantastic moment has um taught me

something that I could take to where I

am in the next my next Journey yeah but

get that CPA and get that attorney for

real

um you need contracts and you need a

money person for real even if it's five

dollars somebody need to show you how to

manage it and that attorney needs to put

a contract on it

good advice as well uh Valerie how about

you

I honestly think I should have taken

fashion a little more seriously because

it was a hustle for me for the longest

time I was like oh making my money on

the side so I would say you know taking

it a little more seriously earlier on

you know because I was going to school

to be an educator and I wanted to teach

so you know maybe I can merge the two

someday you know the fashion and the

education so

absolutely uh something I would love to

know from each one of you uh for anyone

out there trying to get into this career

field whether they're just starting out

in the she and X program or maybe they

haven't even gotten to that point just

yet but they're trying to figure things

out what is one piece of advice you

would offer someone out there watching

I'll start with you Armand

um I mean it's very cliche but just be

yourself

um make your brand speak out for

yourself like for example when I see

each of you girls uh I can see your

brand in you as well I can see it in

your personality I can see it in your

personal style so I think that's

important for you to have your own

unique style and just stick to it but

also

um I feel like starting a brand is just

not about it's not only about creating

you have to do the marketing yourself

you have to do the social media

sometimes and I think that's a that's a

big part as well you have to think as a

businessman and then you have to think

as an artist if you're lucky for

somebody else to do that for you hey but

most of the time that's not that's not

the case so

yeah

and how about you Valerie

definitely I

as a designer and a business you are

wearing so many hats you know and that's

something that I kind of struggle with a

little bit is you know doing the

business and the marketing you know

designing pattern making everything so

I would definitely give advice to you

know delegate things but also first and

foremost keep it real with yourself you

know be authentic tell your story don't

try to be something you're not you know

you you have your own identity and

fashion is an expression an extension of

that so you know just make sure along

your journey that you're just you're

keeping it real and I think that will

take you so far in life if you're just

being authentic like 100 genuine and um

I think that's how you'll stand out in a

Marketplace is just being yourself being

bold being rebellious challenging things

and being disruptive in the fashion

industry and that would be my advice

absolutely I think that's really great

advice and how about you Kenya

um

don't stop uh don't stop and don't stop

again I don't care if you sleeping on

the floor if you're couch surfing if

designing is who you are and is and is

really who

in your gut and you wake up in the

morning and you love it and you cry as

much as I do about fashion don't stop I

don't care what it looks like just

simply don't stop if you don't have a

pattern maker guess what you got the

good will Autumn clothes in there break

them suckers apart lay them down iron

them lay them out flat you just got a

whole pattern shop right there you need

a website developer you need somebody to

do like create you a pitch deck or

whatever Fiverr get it go it's it's ways

to go about all things the barter system

everything but whatever you have to do

make it work but don't stop the

consistency for me is what I feel like

is keeping me going the consistency and

knowing that I can wake up every day and

I feel in my heart of hearts I am really

doing what I am called to do is the one

thing that I can wake up every day and

say that I am filled with gratitude and

I'm grateful for because I am walking

this Earth doing what I think is my

thing and regardless of how much money I

have that it is an emotional experience

for me because I'm excited about that

and it takes and I know it's going to

take me uh to where I need to be but

please don't stop I don't care what nope

my mama

and my grandmother did not understand

nothing about what I was doing they

would see me creating and sewing but

they were like but so and so was hiring

down the street

and I'm like but I don't want to work

their job I would literally rather sleep

in my car I work jobs when I would sit

in the car and I would cry I had a job

and I would go early so I can sit in my

car and cry for 30 minutes get myself

together and then go inside I don't want

that for anybody to want that for myself

I'm not saying quit your job I'm just

saying figure it out give the same

energy that you can give a job give that

to yourself at the same time but please

don't stop don't stop it is worth it the

struggle is worth it the things on the

other side of the struggle is worth it

because you just never know where you

are and then you give up and then you'll

be like man was it all in vain but if I

would have just did it one more time and

then that door will open and that door

will open and that door will open

because for me my grandmother told me at

one time she said

fashion for you is going to be a

Ministry for you it's not just going to

be about the clothes you're going to be

able to tell who you are in your story

to the masses and they're going to say

okay if she can do it a little ball hit

black girl can do it then I can do it

too you know what I mean and it and it

did it is for me it has become what I

consider my Ministry because now we have

a 501c3 day camp for kids that we're

kicking off next year

and

I have another one like because I was

literally the starving artist so like

hopefully by 2024 because we're trying

[Applause]

I'm gonna get

right into it

okay guys

I'm gonna start with

the one thing that I think a lot of

designers brand owners people in general

struggle with

how did you develop and grow a social

media following

now this question is for everybody here

on the panel because I know that you

guys each have a very different

experience with social so I'd love to

know how you got started using social

media and how you developed your

Following over time

I mean for me it was I mean it's been 10

years now which is crazy

I I don't think anyone thought social

media was going to be as industry

important and as brand as important as

it is now so I mean if you scroll down

to my very very early Instagram it had

these weird frames and filters and

you're just kind of having fun and my

friends like do that selfie thing and

I'm like what is this thing gonna make

me sound really old but it was just like

a fun space for me I just had fun with

it so this was like wait it was like

2013. I think I started 14 I started

around the same time I had a fashion

blog so a website when people were

actually reading blogs you know so I

started there and then I started to move

everything over to Instagram around

2014.

um yeah and it just kind of picked up

from there yeah my experience was very

similar to that too I think we all kind

of went in there for fun and it just

kind of happened but I also started

maybe like 10 years ago and it was just

posting selfies and people started

asking questions like what lipstick

you're wearing or what shirt you're

wearing and it kind of just took off

from there

I mean God like it's been crazy just to

see how social media has evolved from 10

years ago you know where we are now and

you know looking at Snapchat filters to

like now just trying to be as real as

possible so just just being at the

Forefront of them seeing how that grows

it's been huge awesome no

for people who are just starting what

would be the best piece of advice that

you guys could give them in terms of how

do you

get the attention of an audience

probably authenticity just staying true

to yourself and

um I feel like it's a little bit more

saturated now where we're finding it a

little bit more difficult to grow but

definitely staying true to yourself

because overall what you might be able

to offer somebody is not what somebody

else is offering someone else so you're

always going to be able to stand out in

that crowd

another thing it's really important to

find your Niche like if you're just

sharing everything at all times so it's

not really like

a guideline or a wheeze now I feel like

followers or communities want like a

reason like what are you actually

offering so I've always looked at like

boxes for me it's like

you can have two you can have three you

can have I have five that I usually

rotate between so like even with the

days I'm like I don't know what to post

about I kind of go back to like my

default setting like I post about

fashion okay I post about you know sport

I post about so find your Niche where

you feel strong in that but be authentic

to you and your reality because if you

have to like make it to make it then

it's like it doesn't really work on

social media the same way and

consistency I think is like one of the

biggest ones I know I should take my own

advice sometimes it's really hard to

stay consistent but I feel like you know

posting at least once a day or even

twice a day sometimes is just so

important along with being authentic and

you know Finding Your Niche and being

consistent I think because the

algorithms really yeah

punish you if you don't or consistent

always they want you to be on there all

time as much as that can sound like a

lot it really is just I think it's

looking at it as part of your job or

part of your everyday life like okay you

wake up what's like part of your morning

routine well it's either get ready go

get make content or have something to

share it really is has to be an

extension of your brand at this point

and I think more than anything too is

like testing and learning because you

know you get to kind of see you know

what is my audience like and what do

they engage with and then continue

amazing now as you guys all started you

know right before social media was

completely saturated

when did it become intentional for you

guys when did it become like okay this

is something serious that I can actually

use as a business

for me it was the first time like I've

been modeling for over a decade now and

you used to be able to like you had to

like walk around to clients knock on

their door and basically show you show

them this book of what you've done like

it was very like old school and I would

walk around like to 20 different people

a day just in the hopes of getting a job

and I remember the first time I sit down

and they're like no no I don't need to

see your book can you pull your phone

out and I was like what do you mean my

phone they're like yeah can I see your

feed and that's when I was like oh it's

not just my mom and my friends looking

it's actually the industry is keeping an

eye on it and that really pivoted my

whole like way of thinking and I was

like oh I really have to like maybe

think about what I put out there

um and it just from there on I could

just see such a change in the industry

um what they perceive what they see and

then Brands like I mean it's been the

last like five years I would say like

people really sell and do things and

like you can really curate for Brands

now on there right

yeah I think in the beginning for us I

remember me having conversations and

people actually like well what is it

that you do or that's fun that's a nice

hobby or oh that's cute you just talked

you know on online to people and I feel

like it was that transition when people

actually started noticing like oh this

is what you're doing or this is

um actually creating like an income for

you or it's becoming like an actual job

that transition has been even a little

still till this day because now when I

say oh like I am on social media you

kind of have a little bit more respect

as opposed to before it was like a cute

hobby before it now it's like okay

you're an influencer like it's actually

a job so that was definitely the

transition for me

I think it was around 2015 or 16 I

actually got hired by guests to create

content for their social media so I was

posting guests and then they actually

hired me to create content for their

social media and their website so I do a

lot of content creation for Brands where

I actually don't post on my own platform

I create for them so that they can use

and that I think was the pivotal moment

for me where I was like okay this is

like turning into a business and it was

about 2015 or 2016. wow and that was

like one of the biggest companies that

like that I worked with back then and

that's just kind of how it kept going

that's why I was like okay this is this

is crazy this is like a big brand and I

have to make it a full-time business

and now what are some things you guys

wish that you knew before you got on

social

that the internet is forever yeah

I mean probably for me just taking that

leap of faith of understanding that it

was actually real I I had a normal you

know corporate nine to five and I feel

like taking that step of like okay I'm

committing and I'm gonna do this full

time and this is the risk that I'm

taking that kind of did it for me I

think the same for me that it was going

to be almost full-time 24 7 and I wish I

knew that there was going to be a lot of

anxiety that came with being on social

media all the time and like I think the

mental health thing for me I wish I knew

which just kind of like I've been doing

it for so long now that you're just you

know kind of not stuck but you were I

wish I knew that there was just so much

it's all evolving and developing and I

think the mental health it's because

it's you do it from the more the moment

you wake up to the moment you go to

sleep like there's just no time and

you're just consumed in it you know 24 7

sometimes you don't even realize it so I

wish I knew that we would be so sucked

in like it's hard to separate real life

and but I think that's why for me it's

been really important to have certain

like lines that I don't cross for myself

and for me it's like I chose to be on

there I chose to be online my family or

friends did not so for me the clear line

is yes I am exposing myself to this I

understand the consequences but like as

much as my mom wants to be like a public

profile and like attack me I'm like you

don't get it that's not the consequences

you want in there yeah

yeah I think it's also knowing when to

take a break yeah too and I think like

that's something that I wish I knew and

you know sometimes I have to remind

myself as well you know like I'll have

my phone out and my husband will be like

again and I'm and you know it just like

sometimes you're so sucked in and you're

so drawn into what's happening in that

world you also have to live in the

present world too yeah it gives you

almost like an adrenaline rush

especially when you can be like creative

too so yeah it's creating those

boundaries like with the platform but

also when you like love something so

much you don't even realize that you're

consumed so much in it I know with me

it's so hard to shut off because I feel

like there's always an idea there's

always something that I could be doing

there's always something that like I'm

trying to do so it's really hard for me

personally to just kind of like not be

thinking about it because it's something

that I genuinely do enjoy even though it

can be draining I love it so much that's

what's good to have like friends or

family sometime and listen when they say

hey

I'm also like can we pay attention to me

for me it's it's helped a lot to like

compartmentalize the hours like almost

like look at it as work sometimes in the

sense as much as schedule yeah as much

as fun like oh but on this day I'll book

the whole day out to like do all these

different scenarios so like that gives

my give me like time or

not panning about not capturing A Moment

Like if you're on vacation you're having

fun like oh my God this would be so

great for social this would be a

beautiful

and you forget to actually experience

the moment like yeah give yourself two

minutes take the picture if you get it

cool if you get the tick tock dope if

not move on like it's not the end of the

world it's worse to miss out on like

life we're not saving lives is what I

mean I like to bring it in reel it in

well it's something that you guys all

started out from coming from a place of

love coming from a place of you know

this is something that you enjoy

personally when did you decide okay this

is

I want to make this a brand I want to

actually have a brand that is

on social as well how did that sort of

realization come to YouTube

for me it was like I've again worked in

the modeling industry and I've kind of

been a hanger my whole life I didn't

have like much of a say I just showed up

and I was the face of everybody else's

brand where the social media was the

only way I could show me or show this

behind the scenes of what I did when I

wasn't working so I had a lot of fun

with showing what the fashion industry

is about about when you're not just on a

Runway when you're not just on a post

they're super edited and like I could

walk around but it also like was weird

because I signed up for this Anonymous

industry that nobody really

new urama like people don't really like

now it's like blasted all over but I

like taking that charge and I feel like

it helped me take charge of my own

career because I could be like

show what my hobbies are I could show

what I care about I can show what I and

that made sense because all of a sudden

Brands see what you actually care about

it and the collaboration with other

brands made a lot more sense because

they were authentic to you and not just

like oh you look like it you could fit

but I actually have an interest in now

in what the brand is it's you as a

person versus you as a model yeah I

prefer it a lot more I think it's a lot

more fun having someone of us saying and

things I mean I feel like it's also like

your own brand and I think that's like

the most amazing part of all the

platforms is that you can create that

yourself and no one's telling you what

it has to be like

um with me I definitely feel like it's

also longevity just knowing that I have

something to also build and fall back on

as well I feel like when I first started

I wasn't sure how far it was going to

take me or how long I was going to do it

for if I wanted to step back and you

know not just do the Social Media stuff

I could so by building a brand I felt

like that was going to be my outlet to

the day that I decide like okay I don't

want to do social media anymore I still

have my brand to kind of fall back on

and still do what I love and still enjoy

what I'm doing

yeah I think for me when I I really love

travel and fashion so it was just

building my brand on like what I love to

do and what I think I like I would want

to see so I

know now how do you sort of get to the

point where you're building a brand

identity you know you have your brand

how do you decide okay this is how I

want to represent myself online this is

what I want to sort of you know

be in terms of my Pub the public

perception of who I am and this is how

I'm going to use social media in order

to do it so Josephine I mean it was

definitely a privilege switch of being

like just a person who posts and then

looking at yourself almost from the

outside and be like okay if like you

have a brand I have a brand as well but

being your own brand you kind of have to

look at the same way

you have to look at it critically you

have to be like what do I set up for

what do I not what is my values what do

I bring to the table what are the

conversation I shouldn't be part of and

why the conversation and then take you

to this take your stance on certain

things and or decide not to so for me it

was like a very like internal like

marketing conversation with myself and

like almost looking at like a product

and like I've seen I know I've been a

product my whole life like I'm a model

being a hanger so my mom always said

this thing when I was younger because it

was kind of weird being judged for my

looks every time you get a no it felt so

personal and she was like well

think about this

your shampoo and I was like where are we

going with this but everybody has

different hair types everybody somebody

wants it foamy somebody wants a fruity

somebody wants it for you know hair

coloring somebody want natural

that doesn't mean any of those shampoo

or bad they're just not the right fit so

for me it's like I was trying to figure

out what shampoo on the Shelf am I and

and stick to that

um so I could also attract the right

kind of clients so

when you're true to your own brand and

you stick and you figure it out and it

it doesn't come overnight it's not like

I'm expecting everybody to know exactly

like if I hand the mic over what's your

brand but if you have this internal

conversation with yourself like your

value and kind of like

step it back a little bit and look at it

as a yourself as a product it really

helped me yeah I think it's just

something that happens over time too and

you just figure it out it's not like

something that you like come up with

overnight and you just kind of test the

waters and what you are authentic to you

know and also just knowing your audience

I feel like you want to be able to come

out with a product that is going to make

sense like me I started in the fashion

beauty industry so I wouldn't

necessarily start like a cooking you

know wear brand or anything like that

and if questions are being asked I'm

gonna know that I'm I'm gonna know the

answer to it and I'm not I'm not just

doing it for the money or to start a

business or start a brand but because

one I genuinely love it and I'm good at

it and I know that I can actually

come out with a good product because

it's something that I'm comfortable with

yeah you kind of see like what your

audience is like drawn to and what

they're really loving and then that's

when you kind of build your brand

identity and focus on that but sometimes

you can also get audience like you

didn't necessarily ask for so there's

also like that like for me transitioning

from like modeling to brand

I mean I was an underwear model for a

long time so like definitely have more

male followers than I expected yeah

which makes sense but for me it's like

having to Pivot and like still deciding

to talk mainly to my female followers

also is kind of like can feel like a

setback at times because you're not

catering so it's also like you want to

cater to the followers you want not

necessarily always to the ones you have

because they might not be right for

where you want to take either your

personal brand or the brand you were

you're coming out with there's so many

things to it so again knowing what your

product is I think is more important

than necessarily always following what

your audience wants because there's a

huge difference there was when I came

out with my fitness brand there's a huge

difference in who our customer was and

who our community was there's a great

overlap but there's definitely also

surprisingly a data we were like there

was full customers we weren't like

aware of was there because our community

was a lot younger and we surprisingly

had also an older audience and like our

actual customer so that surprised us

because we like fully went the first

campaign going like oh we're gonna go

for like younger this this is a

demographic and then we realized and it

pivoted yeah and sometimes you learn

from that too yeah so like sometimes

you'll push out a product that not

necessarily hits the audience that you

typically have but then you reach a

different audience and you're like oh oh

my God like now I have another audience

and I can tap into that as well so

that's you know from the brand

perspective like we're always thinking

you know how can we experiment too like

maybe there's something that hasn't been

done before and that might be a surprise

and Delight for our audience and maybe

new people as well no I mean Erica from

a business perspective like how what are

some best practices that you know young

designers can use to really shape you

know their brands on social

I think like the the biggest bottom line

is there's no one way for anybody like

you know there's not like one size meets

all everybody has a unique voice and I

think it's tapping into that and what

makes you special and you know yourself

better than anybody else does and I

think it's highlighting that and I think

once you know what that is and once you

know what resonates with your audience

and just staying true to yourself

that makes much stronger I would say

best practice by each platform and again

like each platform has a different type

of audience so you know Facebook is

generally an older

demographic uh Snapchat very young uh

Instagram is probably a millennial like

myself

and then Tick Tock you know that's where

you can have a lot of fun so I think

everybody is on Tech talk but

um it's it's all it's all up to you

I mean do you guys see a big difference

in terms of your follower groups based

on the platform

yeah I feel like even with the platforms

I don't know if any of you guys feel

like this but I definitely feel like I

also have like different Vibes for each

platform like when I think about my

Instagram it's kind of like put together

a little bit more but my Tick Tock just

seems like I show my personality a bit

more just like I would on YouTube so I

think it's just definitely also learning

the platform and the audience that's on

the platform for you to be able to

really just

be who you are on there but I I've

noticed that with the new platforms that

I have been

um on that I kind of like I'm a little

more particular like okay maybe I

shouldn't post that on Instagram but

like it's totally okay for me to put it

on put it on Tick Tock

um but I think it's just learning that

specific platform I think that's like

key too is that content on a certain

platform does not belong across the

board so it's being very specific to

each audience and each platform and I've

noticed too even with when I when I

tried to like it's great to recycle

obviously your content and everything

because you want to be able to to do

that but anytime I post something on

Tick Tock it makes sense but then the

moment I post it on Instagram everyone's

kind of like oh what is this or why did

you post that or it's like a little

cringy or like it just you have to learn

the platform that you're do you find

that Instagram's like more curated and

it's just more like you want it to look

perfect yeah as opposed to like on Tick

Tock like I can wake up without makeup

on my YouTube I can wake up I feel like

it's pivoting though yeah it's first

pivoting a little bit more

in order for it to still continue to be

a good platform I feel like they're

starting to now be a little bit more

like okay like I'm starting to

understand it but I personally because

I've been doing it for so long I feel

like that transition has been a little

bit more harder for me for me to just

actually

uh me not cringe what I'm looking at I'm

like okay maybe I shouldn't but just

learning the platforms and just actually

knowing what you're wanting to do in

each one because at the end of the day

they're also different I don't know like

it's like a different audience too that

you're kind of gravitating towards right

I mean one of the things I love about

your content is that your entire family

is there and some they sneak peek in

some of the content how do you navigate

that I mean my whole life has been on

social media might be a little bit

different from your guys's experience

but I've started and I share everything

and I feel like that's been a little

harder for me to transition because I'm

not just a brand I'm kind of like you

know I had a lot of my audience based

off of showing everything you know like

I've showed mom life I've showed my

struggles I've shown like it's been very

raw I don't do a lot of the perfect

editing or anything like that so

navigating it's more difficult back to

her with the mental health stuff just

having people have too many opinions

sometimes because

you can talk about me or like have an

opinion about me but then you know how

she was mentioning about her mom like

sometimes they don't understand that

what comes with everything you know like

I can pose my husband and then now he's

involved in something that he didn't ask

for you know like he didn't ask to be on

that platform but

um I mean it's been great too though

because I feel like I have a genuine you

know relationship with all of the people

who support me like whenever I do

anything I know that they're looking at

me they're like oh my God I'm genuinely

so proud of you because they've watched

me grow from you know 20 years old to

where I'm at now I'm gonna talk about

each but where I'm at now and all the

years and all the growth has been

amazing but it just it comes with a lot

for sure wow I mean how do all of you

guys balance that sort of connection

with your followers because they are

very invested they follow you you know

through the years they know the ins and

outs of your career in your life like

what is that aspect of being on social

like

I mean I think I'm I'm pretty authentic

online but it's probably just 20 of who

I am privately I think it's important

for me to keep a line like I I love to

show what I do at work I love to show a

lot of like what my life entails yet my

private life for me that has been like

unless somebody has decided to be in

Social like my husband is on a social so

I feel comfortable with him the friends

I have that is on a social feel

comfortable with them but

I just know my friend group and my

family from home haven't decided so for

me that's my line and like for me that's

not my mitigation but it's different for

everybody and I also think I mean I know

because both me and my husband and

social that day where kids come along

that's also going to be a conversation

do you share that do you not and then

where is that line they can't really

answer and I think you you know best as

a parent what works for you and your

family but yeah I think it's it's

important to or it's been for me to have

days where I'm just like not in like

content creator or I'm just me

well you get to choose you know I think

that's what's the great part about the

platform is that you get to choose what

you want to show and you know

I mean like my natural state is to

always pull out my phone and capture

things but it's deciding is this

something that everybody needs to see or

is it something that I just want to

remember myself

I feel like that with with a lot of the

stuff that I do too I feel like I've

always tried to be very

to just the makeup and the fashion as

well though whenever I do posts like you

hardly actually will see any like actual

mom content like I don't do like the mom

vlogging and the mom you know I post my

kids occasionally but

it's that barrier of I don't want

opinions on how I'm parenting or how I'm

raising my kids or how like because I

feel like that's just a different

conversation but just trying to balance

to make sure that people don't forget

how I started like what led me to where

I'm at now and it was usually it was the

Beauty and the fashion stuff

now I know that you guys didn't

necessarily start out with the goal of

growing followers but tell me a little

bit about how once you really sort of

you know stepped into okay I'm going to

turn this into an actual business how

did you go about sort of building an

audience and growing that audience

I think like it all starts with you know

asking your audience what do they want

to see so you know the audience starts

small no matter what you have to start

somewhere no matter what

um and then as you see more people

following you're like okay well I think

I understand what my audience likes

sometimes they won't like something and

that's okay and you can pivot from that

and you can learn from that and that's I

think that's the key is just

continuously learning and your audience

also continuously evolves so it's just

growing and evolving with your audience

and making sure that you're staying true

to your brand and making sure that like

whatever piece of content that you're

creating actually accentuates what

you're trying to you know give out

I was doing a lot of cross promotion

with um you know other influencers and

bloggers and Brands I feel like that

really helped me grow a following like

just you know my friends who were doing

the same things as me and like-minded

individuals we were you know traveling

together shooting together and doing all

that kinds of stuff so I felt like that

really helped my following grow a lot in

an organic way I also find that works

with Brands like yeah like I feel like

when you collaborate with other brands

or just like cross mode lift each other

up and like if you find like-minded

Brands doing like collaborations makes a

lot of sense or even just like

have an event or do something together

or like yeah share each other highlight

yeah yeah it helps a lot

no each of you is a brand owner when it

came time to you know

launch your Brands how did you go about

developing the social strategy

like with JoJo when it was time for

launch like what was the

um

you know initial social strategy and how

has that evolved over time we actually

created the social platform way before

we created a brand we were a fitness

Community just sharing that we were

working out me and my best friend and

just like sharing like the commitment of

having someone to be in the gym with you

because for me that's always the hardest

part is feeling like motivated so having

someone else who are like accountable

really helped and that we shared that

and we shared partner workouts and

realized oh people also like to have

accountability and like they found other

people and then we were a social media

platform for

three or four years before we build a

brand and it actually was like oh here

might be something and the community

asked for stuff so we're like oh we

could turn this into a bread

what was really hard was like how do you

then take that Community turn into a

brand without fully forgetting the

community but also knowing like hey we

are also a shoppable brand now we aren't

just like the social media platform so

that was that's something we're still

learning every day and like each

campaign is new and different and we're

pivoting constantly different like my

partner just gave birth three weeks ago

so that is also like a whole new chapter

we're adding on to the social media

platform and just like

you know having a partner and everything

has been super super helpful but yeah no

I think for us it was

showing more of the brand taking people

behind the scenes and then taking the

experience we've had in the industry of

like and finding other brands we love

what they do feel inspired love

Pinterest

um to get inspiration from mood boards

and campaigns and shooting and just it

was also really really fun to be the

creative director of shoots instead of

being in front of their camera so but

being behind the camera while I was

hoping to find it was really challenging

but also super creative and yeah every

day every campaign is different every

because we're still constantly a market

that that's the fun thing about social

media you can really test the waters you

like I said our first campaign came out

way too young and way too like

happy-go-lucky and we're like oh that's

not what they want but that was kind of

what our social media present has been

so realizing okay we're turning into a

little bit more fashion we need a

different more mature concept but on how

do we translate that in with our

community so we're still testing the

waters we've only been out for a year

with the brand

yeah I thi",F,1090,12,1,"Apr 5, 2023",0.633828041167137,0.187793427230047,0.197183098591549,-0.323724620027002,40,42
170,Taylor Stitch,The Last Boots You'll Buy - Our Boot Lineup | Taylor Stitch,"hey guys Luke here from Taylor Stitch

I'm here with our lead product designer

Nick Kemp

we just received a huge restock on all

of our boots and so we thought it'd be a

good time to kind of create a video to

talk about what goes into our boots what

the story is behind them the different

styles and some consistencies that we

make sure we keep with every launch

across the board so we've got kind of a

range of our full core assortment here

we're going to kind of talk through

things around just like the general

Styles and some of the construction

details that go into each so we're not

going to go over every single boot but

the kind of the core styles of boot that

we have are really a few and then we

swap out leathers and Soles and kind of

do things to keep it fresh but really

the core assortment consists of the

tried and true classic what we call a

trench boot this is just you know

classic easy wearing boot we do it in a

couple of different Leathers this here

is the whiskey we also do it in this

really great golden brown waxed suede

my my favorite silhouette that we do in

Boots is the ranch boot a classic kind

of pull-on style super comfortable

pretty much wearable with anything you

know a clean kind of Chelsea silhouette

but also a rugged so kind of crosses uh

you know the the whole Spectrum there

and then lastly the Moto boot which is

our uh true dual layer Cap Toe Moto boot

very similar to the trench and actually

not lastly I forgot one but we do the

Rambler chukka this one here is in the

uh really nice suede so

um I'm gonna pass it over to Nick now we

kind of went through the Styles and he

can kind of talk about some of the

construction details that are consistent

across the board yeah so across the

board here all these boots are handmade

and Leon Mexico which is the boot making

capital of the world

um every style we make uh is full

Goodyear welt which means that as when

you wear out that sole you can get the

these resold and they'll be good as new

you have a full hot lined cork insole

stainless steel shank construction and

you have a silicone injected foam insert

on there so these these suckers are as

comfortable as sneakers as soon as you

take them out of the box

every one of these also has a Vibram

sole on it which we consider the gold

standard of rubber soles

um and these these guys are built to

last you a lifetime with proper care and

and um you know everything these suckers

will you know be handed down to the Next

Generation

172,Taylor Stitch,How To Re-Wax Your TS Jacket | Taylor Stitch Care Guide,"rolling yeah rolling all right hey y'all

Nick from Taylor Stitch uh today we are

gonna do a little uh re-waxing tutorial

so first we need a good old used jacket

here's one of our favorites the old

Rover jacket as you can see a lot of

wear the wax will start to just kind of

like rub off and and just kind of like

Get get dry spots on it so um usually

you can you can see this it kind of like

sticks out from the rest of the jackets

usually where things are a little bit

dry and not as glossy looking right and

uh you can um touch those spots up with

a little bit of um the TS favorite otter

wax here

um here we just have a re-waxing bar

and uh what you're going to want to do

is find some areas on the jacket that

are a little bit dried out and you're

just going to want to take this bar

and just start hitting those areas I

like to go in a little circular motion

uh and it'll take some friction to get

that wax a little bit warm and start

coming off

onto the fabric

you can kind of see here we're getting

getting some going

and I just kind of start at one point

and just kind of keep keep circling it

out

foreign

as you can see that kind of sticks out

from the the rest of the

the jacket right so we're just going to

want to get that soaked in so we're

going to take a little uh hot air gun

here or you can use a blow dryer if that

is your flavor

and same as we did with the bar we just

kind of want to work it in a circular

motion

again we're just trying to get that wax

to heat up a little bit

and uh just kind of work it in to the

fabric I also will use kind of my hands

as well you can also use otter wax sells

this great Little Brush as well that you

can use you can also use this brush to

kind of clean off some excess dirt as

well

um and and once that gets heated up it

kind of starts to sink into the jacket I

do let this cure for about 24 hours

before I'm actually going to wear it or

put it in into use

um and then you can just again kind of

continue around uh the jacket or

whatever piece you're kind of working on

and just kind of spot treat you can also

take this same kind of idea to wax a

garment that has never been waxed and

you can just take this bar and kind of

do that same uh motion throughout the

entire jacket and heating it up in

different you know kind of sections and

you can wax a whole jacket

thanks for your time

go have a good one

176,Taylor Stitch,How To Care For Leather & Suede Boots | Taylor Stitch Care Guide,"hey guys how's it going Luke from TS

here hey uh today we want to talk about

how to care for uh your Taylor Stitch

boots really this goes for any uh you

know nice Quality Boot or shoes pretty

similar process across the board we've

got a couple different

um of our boot Styles here to kind of

showcase

um really before we even get into that

um some nice things about our Boots

These are going to last you a long time

if you take care of them and so that's

kind of why this cleaning and

conditioning process is a little bit

important all of our boots use a

Goodyear welt construction which is

great I kind of tell folks like hey if

you buy our boots you should probably

plan on resolding them someday because

they shouldn't last you that long if you

take care of them we also do some things

with our boots that make them kind of

unique they have like a cork midsole

which a lot of brands use it's super

comfortable we also use a silicone

injected insole almost like a sneaker

style so they're really comfortable

right out of the box this is our Ranch

boot this is my personal favorite boot I

wear these all the the time and then

this is our Moto boot we do both of

these in a handful of different Leathers

we've also got a couple other styles so

check out the website but really what

we're going to do to get into it today

is just kind of show the cleaning and

Care process to do that you know just

get yourself like some pretty basic uh

setup items really all you need is a

brush and some good quality conditioner

I like this stuff right here this

Cadillac but even some just old-school

Mingo oil will get the job done as well

and then a cloth that's about all you

really need you know I like to use a

couple different brushes

I like one like this with a little bit

of a shorter uh bristle to it so that

that way you can kind of get in there

it's a little bit stiffer than the

longer brush but if this is all you got

it's going to get the job done

um so really what I do is I knock the

heavy stuff off first get in there in

the well and just make sure you get all

that dirt out of there that's like one

of the most important areas to clean

because that dirt over time is going to

kind of cause a grit and abrasion in

there and just wear down the welt so

make sure first of all you hit that

really nice with the brush

you can see back there we've got a

little bit of dirt in some cases like a

damp towel might help get some of that

stuff out of there we don't have one in

front of us right now but

um you could certainly do that

and then I take a bit of a longer brush

and just make sure the whole thing's

kind of clear of dirt debris give

yourself a nice clean starting point so

that as you start to condition that

leather it's you're not just rubbing

dirt into it right get all that stuff

off the surface

I like to hit the soles too you can see

these are a little bit dirty you

probably should have cleaned these up a

little bit before we started

um but hey these will work

so from there all you really got to do

let's get your towel I like this one has

kind of a different surface on both

sides it's a little bit brushed and soft

a little bit of leather conditioner goes

a long way

I like to kind of bat it into the cloth

first

I'd like to get my hand inside gives you

a good way to hold the boot and then

just start working it into the surface

you don't have to rub super hard at

first just cover the surface

you're going to start to see some areas

darken that's not a problem those are

going to lighten up a little bit once

the conditioning oil can penetrate the

boot overall

and I'll spare you the time today I

won't go through the whole boot but one

thing you want to do is definitely get

in and around that well that's really

important to keep that leather

conditioned also the high wear areas

like where your toe flexes

just kind of give it a rub in and then I

keep my uh cloth separate I keep one

side for applying the cream and then one

side for removing the excess

just kind of go through lightly you do

want that cream to uh you don't want to

wipe it off entirely sometimes if you've

got the time let it sit for an hour or

so give it a chance to penetrate

but once you get that excess wiped off

you know I'm not pushing hard just

lightly then I come back through with my

brush one more time

just give it a little bit of a buff

that kind of shines the leather up so if

you're not into that look that's cool

you don't have to do that

step

and then I let them rest you know I

usually don't wear them for a couple

days after I condition them you also

don't want to put them in like direct

sunlight but that's kind of the case in

general that can kind of break down the

leather a little bit quicker over time

but other than that you're good to go do

that you know as needed you don't have

to over condition just make sure that

leather is not starting to look cracked

or dried out and you should be good to

go

as always give us a shot if you have any

questions and uh yeah thanks folks
