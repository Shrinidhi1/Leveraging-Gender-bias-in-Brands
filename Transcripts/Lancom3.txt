hey when was the last time that we

like got ready together for something

it went so long this is lancome taunt

adult foundation it's like the perfect

coverage we can do it like an everyday

beauty makeup routine or like if you

want to do like a full-on glam look you

can do that too

the first time i helped you get ready

for prom

was very emotional

actually it was your first school dance

it was homecoming

and you came down the stairs and i think

my he was in tears

because you're all grown up you know

this is my go-to lashy doll these

bristles are so spaced out covers my

lashes perfectly i love your natural

makeup because it really complements

your gorgeous face

i love your red lip i think it goes

perfect with your red dress and you look

fabulous and usual

so chic

so grown making me cry
