the thing about personal ambitions is

they're just that

personal

it can't be duplicated

though carbon-copy exists you move you

think you do all on your terms

but this personal journey you set out on

isn't solitary people you never knew

before become your closest friends

communities you never heard of become

your extended family you move through

new scenarios scenes and areas with ease

every moment you breathe can be built on

captured and acted on all in the pursuit

of chasing your dreams and when you can

do that the path you seek will inspire

others as they to set out on their

personal quest so think about your

ambition

and focus on the forward

that's my journey
