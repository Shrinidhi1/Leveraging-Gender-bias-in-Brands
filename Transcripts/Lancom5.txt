as a young girl i had big dreams and my

education played a major role in my

pursuit of them

i remember a book called once a week

comprehension from elementary school

that taught us english grammar

punctuation and parts of speech

it was tedious homework at the time but

every time i make a speech like this one

write a book or even review a script i

have it to thank i went to drama school

to work on my craft as an actor and

there i learned that the best way to

embody another person is by first

embracing myself

i don't think i would have learned that

lesson as soundly on my own

i've always loved learning and i believe

that learners change the world and

define the future with my journey in

education i've had the chance to write

my own future and now partnering with

lancome i want to give more women of

color the chance to do the same
