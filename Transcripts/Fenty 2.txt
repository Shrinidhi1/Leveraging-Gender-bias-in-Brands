anyway just tell me about made it good

morning

it was a good one then tell me that

moment is happened but it's a near happy

y'all lookin bust it and this is why I'm

even here with this video today right

now cuz cuz I was doing the most last

night so we don't have fancy Beauty to

the rescue

we are making a brand-new concealer so

as long as you know you're Pro filter

shade we have a corresponding concealer

to match and you don't even have to

figure it out I like to either put it on

my hand like that my hand like that and

I have a lot more scarcity when I pick

it up and I put it on the brush if I'm

having it an early morning after a long

night you start blending it out with the

precision concealer brush so I usually

like to put up like this in the bottom

of my eye where I want a definition do

you see all this brushes buff that out

it's like milk no spots just look at

that especially with a formula like this

that dries down and mattifies eventually

you expect it to start getting tacky and

paint up but this formula does not look

at how perfect of a finish it gets you

over here it's almost like a filter no

caking no creasing

no it's just a bit like round her

blemish like this one I like to just

bend that out my concealer brush like

that is magic just goes away buffers out

I obviously haven't set anything here

before I could set that there's a little

bit of creasing right there sweep once

wait y'all back to him

she's 2019
