- [Narrator] Stepping out
of your home means battling

with dust, pollution, and heat,

which affects our skin,
causing pimples or acne

and this makes shaving
difficult for most men.

However, we have a solution,

Gillette SkinGuard, a
razor which shaves hair

while barely touching the skin.

The first step to start shaving

is hydrating your face with warm water,

which helps soften the hair,

giving you a more comfortable shave.

Using a shaving gel.

This helps provide better lubrication

so that the razor can glide smoothly,

giving you a closer shave.

Gillette SkinGuard is designed

for anyone who loves their
skin and fears shaving

because of acne or sensitive skin.

The razor shaves hair and guards skin

due to its unique skin guard
position between the blades.

It works to minimize tug and pull

and cut hair at skin level,

helping to prevent irritation.

The Gillette SkinGuard
Razor is also equipped

with a precision trimmer at the back

to help you reach the hard places,

and style facial hair

which is difficult using the normal razor.

After the shave, rinse
you face with cold water

and dry it off.

Use an aftershave to soothe your skin.

And that's why Gillette
SkinGuard gives you

the most comfortable shave.
