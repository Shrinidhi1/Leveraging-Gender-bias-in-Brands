hello then do I look dangerous I am

dangerous ha ha but I'm also a caring

sensitive and devastatingly good-looking

man look at me or even better look at my

dream this part is reserved for that

special Malabar fish curry recipe I make

on a leisurely Sunday afternoon it's

great here I store my solo kinetic music

performances just to entertain myself

and this is where I store my

shock-and-awe

chess moves to inflict incredible shock

and all but the most vital part of my

brain is the part that generates complex

neurological signals telling me that I'm

not me

when I don't smell of Old Spice

deodorant thank you

because only Old Spice deodorant has all

the ingredients that make me an

all-conquering sophisticated and

mantastic man

so mantastic in fact even James Bond

calls me for advice now if you'll excuse

me I have a lady to read some poetry to

and yes I wrote it
