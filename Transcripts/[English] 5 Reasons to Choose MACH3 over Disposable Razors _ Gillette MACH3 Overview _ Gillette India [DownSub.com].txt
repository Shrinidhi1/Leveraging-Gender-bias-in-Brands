- [Narrator] As men, we've
all used disposable razors

once in our lifetime,

or probably still using it,

however, it's time to upgrade.

(upbeat music continues)

Here are a few reasons

why Gillette Mach3 razors are superior

compared to your three
blade disposable razors.

First reason is sharper blades,

which are engineered to
give you a close shave.

The Gillette Mach3 is equipped
with thinner, sharper blades

with better coating which
gives a smoother glide,

resulting in less force
being used while shaving.

Long-lasting blades,

the Gillette Mach3
blades are built stronger

and durable as compared
to disposable blades,

so they hold up better to wear and tear

and last as long as 60 days.

Comfort strip,

the Gillette Mach3 comes

with a blue-green comfort strip,

which is an indicator for dull blades.

If the strip is faded or white,

it's a sign that the blades have worn out

and need to be changed.

Another reason is adjustable head.

The Gillette Mach3 comes
with an adjustable head,

which adjusts to the
contours of your face,

which an ordinary razor cannot,

so you get a smoother precision shape.

The open architecture of
the blades make it easier

to clean out the excessive
hair that gets stuck.

Just rinsing it with water is enough

to get rid of the hair

instead of wiping it
with a cloth or towel.

And these are the reasons

for you to dump the disposable razor

and upgrade to a Gillette
Mach3 razor today.
