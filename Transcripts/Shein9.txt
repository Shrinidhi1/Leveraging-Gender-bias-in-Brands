I'm gonna get

right into it

okay guys

I'm gonna start with

the one thing that I think a lot of

designers brand owners people in general

struggle with

how did you develop and grow a social

media following

now this question is for everybody here

on the panel because I know that you

guys each have a very different

experience with social so I'd love to

know how you got started using social

media and how you developed your

Following over time

I mean for me it was I mean it's been 10

years now which is crazy

I I don't think anyone thought social

media was going to be as industry

important and as brand as important as

it is now so I mean if you scroll down

to my very very early Instagram it had

these weird frames and filters and

you're just kind of having fun and my

friends like do that selfie thing and

I'm like what is this thing gonna make

me sound really old but it was just like

a fun space for me I just had fun with

it so this was like wait it was like

2013. I think I started 14 I started

around the same time I had a fashion

blog so a website when people were

actually reading blogs you know so I

started there and then I started to move

everything over to Instagram around

2014.

um yeah and it just kind of picked up

from there yeah my experience was very

similar to that too I think we all kind

of went in there for fun and it just

kind of happened but I also started

maybe like 10 years ago and it was just

posting selfies and people started

asking questions like what lipstick

you're wearing or what shirt you're

wearing and it kind of just took off

from there

I mean God like it's been crazy just to

see how social media has evolved from 10

years ago you know where we are now and

you know looking at Snapchat filters to

like now just trying to be as real as

possible so just just being at the

Forefront of them seeing how that grows

it's been huge awesome no

for people who are just starting what

would be the best piece of advice that

you guys could give them in terms of how

do you

get the attention of an audience

probably authenticity just staying true

to yourself and

um I feel like it's a little bit more

saturated now where we're finding it a

little bit more difficult to grow but

definitely staying true to yourself

because overall what you might be able

to offer somebody is not what somebody

else is offering someone else so you're

always going to be able to stand out in

that crowd

another thing it's really important to

find your Niche like if you're just

sharing everything at all times so it's

not really like

a guideline or a wheeze now I feel like

followers or communities want like a

reason like what are you actually

offering so I've always looked at like

boxes for me it's like

you can have two you can have three you

can have I have five that I usually

rotate between so like even with the

days I'm like I don't know what to post

about I kind of go back to like my

default setting like I post about

fashion okay I post about you know sport

I post about so find your Niche where

you feel strong in that but be authentic

to you and your reality because if you

have to like make it to make it then

it's like it doesn't really work on

social media the same way and

consistency I think is like one of the

biggest ones I know I should take my own

advice sometimes it's really hard to

stay consistent but I feel like you know

posting at least once a day or even

twice a day sometimes is just so

important along with being authentic and

you know Finding Your Niche and being

consistent I think because the

algorithms really yeah

punish you if you don't or consistent

always they want you to be on there all

time as much as that can sound like a

lot it really is just I think it's

looking at it as part of your job or

part of your everyday life like okay you

wake up what's like part of your morning

routine well it's either get ready go

get make content or have something to

share it really is has to be an

extension of your brand at this point

and I think more than anything too is

like testing and learning because you

know you get to kind of see you know

what is my audience like and what do

they engage with and then continue

amazing now as you guys all started you

know right before social media was

completely saturated

when did it become intentional for you

guys when did it become like okay this

is something serious that I can actually

use as a business

for me it was the first time like I've

been modeling for over a decade now and

you used to be able to like you had to

like walk around to clients knock on

their door and basically show you show

them this book of what you've done like

it was very like old school and I would

walk around like to 20 different people

a day just in the hopes of getting a job

and I remember the first time I sit down

and they're like no no I don't need to

see your book can you pull your phone

out and I was like what do you mean my

phone they're like yeah can I see your

feed and that's when I was like oh it's

not just my mom and my friends looking

it's actually the industry is keeping an

eye on it and that really pivoted my

whole like way of thinking and I was

like oh I really have to like maybe

think about what I put out there

um and it just from there on I could

just see such a change in the industry

um what they perceive what they see and

then Brands like I mean it's been the

last like five years I would say like

people really sell and do things and

like you can really curate for Brands

now on there right

yeah I think in the beginning for us I

remember me having conversations and

people actually like well what is it

that you do or that's fun that's a nice

hobby or oh that's cute you just talked

you know on online to people and I feel

like it was that transition when people

actually started noticing like oh this

is what you're doing or this is

um actually creating like an income for

you or it's becoming like an actual job

that transition has been even a little

still till this day because now when I

say oh like I am on social media you

kind of have a little bit more respect

as opposed to before it was like a cute

hobby before it now it's like okay

you're an influencer like it's actually

a job so that was definitely the

transition for me

I think it was around 2015 or 16 I

actually got hired by guests to create

content for their social media so I was

posting guests and then they actually

hired me to create content for their

social media and their website so I do a

lot of content creation for Brands where

I actually don't post on my own platform

I create for them so that they can use

and that I think was the pivotal moment

for me where I was like okay this is

like turning into a business and it was

about 2015 or 2016. wow and that was

like one of the biggest companies that

like that I worked with back then and

that's just kind of how it kept going

that's why I was like okay this is this

is crazy this is like a big brand and I

have to make it a full-time business

and now what are some things you guys

wish that you knew before you got on

social

that the internet is forever yeah

I mean probably for me just taking that

leap of faith of understanding that it

was actually real I I had a normal you

know corporate nine to five and I feel

like taking that step of like okay I'm

committing and I'm gonna do this full

time and this is the risk that I'm

taking that kind of did it for me I

think the same for me that it was going

to be almost full-time 24 7 and I wish I

knew that there was going to be a lot of

anxiety that came with being on social

media all the time and like I think the

mental health thing for me I wish I knew

which just kind of like I've been doing

it for so long now that you're just you

know kind of not stuck but you were I

wish I knew that there was just so much

it's all evolving and developing and I

think the mental health it's because

it's you do it from the more the moment

you wake up to the moment you go to

sleep like there's just no time and

you're just consumed in it you know 24 7

sometimes you don't even realize it so I

wish I knew that we would be so sucked

in like it's hard to separate real life

and but I think that's why for me it's

been really important to have certain

like lines that I don't cross for myself

and for me it's like I chose to be on

there I chose to be online my family or

friends did not so for me the clear line

is yes I am exposing myself to this I

understand the consequences but like as

much as my mom wants to be like a public

profile and like attack me I'm like you

don't get it that's not the consequences

you want in there yeah

yeah I think it's also knowing when to

take a break yeah too and I think like

that's something that I wish I knew and

you know sometimes I have to remind

myself as well you know like I'll have

my phone out and my husband will be like

again and I'm and you know it just like

sometimes you're so sucked in and you're

so drawn into what's happening in that

world you also have to live in the

present world too yeah it gives you

almost like an adrenaline rush

especially when you can be like creative

too so yeah it's creating those

boundaries like with the platform but

also when you like love something so

much you don't even realize that you're

consumed so much in it I know with me

it's so hard to shut off because I feel

like there's always an idea there's

always something that I could be doing

there's always something that like I'm

trying to do so it's really hard for me

personally to just kind of like not be

thinking about it because it's something

that I genuinely do enjoy even though it

can be draining I love it so much that's

what's good to have like friends or

family sometime and listen when they say

hey

I'm also like can we pay attention to me

for me it's it's helped a lot to like

compartmentalize the hours like almost

like look at it as work sometimes in the

sense as much as schedule yeah as much

as fun like oh but on this day I'll book

the whole day out to like do all these

different scenarios so like that gives

my give me like time or

not panning about not capturing A Moment

Like if you're on vacation you're having

fun like oh my God this would be so

great for social this would be a

beautiful

and you forget to actually experience

the moment like yeah give yourself two

minutes take the picture if you get it

cool if you get the tick tock dope if

not move on like it's not the end of the

world it's worse to miss out on like

life we're not saving lives is what I

mean I like to bring it in reel it in

well it's something that you guys all

started out from coming from a place of

love coming from a place of you know

this is something that you enjoy

personally when did you decide okay this

is

I want to make this a brand I want to

actually have a brand that is

on social as well how did that sort of

realization come to YouTube

for me it was like I've again worked in

the modeling industry and I've kind of

been a hanger my whole life I didn't

have like much of a say I just showed up

and I was the face of everybody else's

brand where the social media was the

only way I could show me or show this

behind the scenes of what I did when I

wasn't working so I had a lot of fun

with showing what the fashion industry

is about about when you're not just on a

Runway when you're not just on a post

they're super edited and like I could

walk around but it also like was weird

because I signed up for this Anonymous

industry that nobody really

new urama like people don't really like

now it's like blasted all over but I

like taking that charge and I feel like

it helped me take charge of my own

career because I could be like

show what my hobbies are I could show

what I care about I can show what I and

that made sense because all of a sudden

Brands see what you actually care about

it and the collaboration with other

brands made a lot more sense because

they were authentic to you and not just

like oh you look like it you could fit

but I actually have an interest in now

in what the brand is it's you as a

person versus you as a model yeah I

prefer it a lot more I think it's a lot

more fun having someone of us saying and

things I mean I feel like it's also like

your own brand and I think that's like

the most amazing part of all the

platforms is that you can create that

yourself and no one's telling you what

it has to be like

um with me I definitely feel like it's

also longevity just knowing that I have

something to also build and fall back on

as well I feel like when I first started

I wasn't sure how far it was going to

take me or how long I was going to do it

for if I wanted to step back and you

know not just do the Social Media stuff

I could so by building a brand I felt

like that was going to be my outlet to

the day that I decide like okay I don't

want to do social media anymore I still

have my brand to kind of fall back on

and still do what I love and still enjoy

what I'm doing

yeah I think for me when I I really love

travel and fashion so it was just

building my brand on like what I love to

do and what I think I like I would want

to see so I

know now how do you sort of get to the

point where you're building a brand

identity you know you have your brand

how do you decide okay this is how I

want to represent myself online this is

what I want to sort of you know

be in terms of my Pub the public

perception of who I am and this is how

I'm going to use social media in order

to do it so Josephine I mean it was

definitely a privilege switch of being

like just a person who posts and then

looking at yourself almost from the

outside and be like okay if like you

have a brand I have a brand as well but

being your own brand you kind of have to

look at the same way

you have to look at it critically you

have to be like what do I set up for

what do I not what is my values what do

I bring to the table what are the

conversation I shouldn't be part of and

why the conversation and then take you

to this take your stance on certain

things and or decide not to so for me it

was like a very like internal like

marketing conversation with myself and

like almost looking at like a product

and like I've seen I know I've been a

product my whole life like I'm a model

being a hanger so my mom always said

this thing when I was younger because it

was kind of weird being judged for my

looks every time you get a no it felt so

personal and she was like well

think about this

your shampoo and I was like where are we

going with this but everybody has

different hair types everybody somebody

wants it foamy somebody wants a fruity

somebody wants it for you know hair

coloring somebody want natural

that doesn't mean any of those shampoo

or bad they're just not the right fit so

for me it's like I was trying to figure

out what shampoo on the Shelf am I and

and stick to that

um so I could also attract the right

kind of clients so

when you're true to your own brand and

you stick and you figure it out and it

it doesn't come overnight it's not like

I'm expecting everybody to know exactly

like if I hand the mic over what's your

brand but if you have this internal

conversation with yourself like your

value and kind of like

step it back a little bit and look at it

as a yourself as a product it really

helped me yeah I think it's just

something that happens over time too and

you just figure it out it's not like

something that you like come up with

overnight and you just kind of test the

waters and what you are authentic to you

know and also just knowing your audience

I feel like you want to be able to come

out with a product that is going to make

sense like me I started in the fashion

beauty industry so I wouldn't

necessarily start like a cooking you

know wear brand or anything like that

and if questions are being asked I'm

gonna know that I'm I'm gonna know the

answer to it and I'm not I'm not just

doing it for the money or to start a

business or start a brand but because

one I genuinely love it and I'm good at

it and I know that I can actually

come out with a good product because

it's something that I'm comfortable with

yeah you kind of see like what your

audience is like drawn to and what

they're really loving and then that's

when you kind of build your brand

identity and focus on that but sometimes

you can also get audience like you

didn't necessarily ask for so there's

also like that like for me transitioning

from like modeling to brand

I mean I was an underwear model for a

long time so like definitely have more

male followers than I expected yeah

which makes sense but for me it's like

having to Pivot and like still deciding

to talk mainly to my female followers

also is kind of like can feel like a

setback at times because you're not

catering so it's also like you want to

cater to the followers you want not

necessarily always to the ones you have

because they might not be right for

where you want to take either your

personal brand or the brand you were

you're coming out with there's so many

things to it so again knowing what your

product is I think is more important

than necessarily always following what

your audience wants because there's a

huge difference there was when I came

out with my fitness brand there's a huge

difference in who our customer was and

who our community was there's a great

overlap but there's definitely also

surprisingly a data we were like there

was full customers we weren't like

aware of was there because our community

was a lot younger and we surprisingly

had also an older audience and like our

actual customer so that surprised us

because we like fully went the first

campaign going like oh we're gonna go

for like younger this this is a

demographic and then we realized and it

pivoted yeah and sometimes you learn

from that too yeah so like sometimes

you'll push out a product that not

necessarily hits the audience that you

typically have but then you reach a

different audience and you're like oh oh

my God like now I have another audience

and I can tap into that as well so

that's you know from the brand

perspective like we're always thinking

you know how can we experiment too like

maybe there's something that hasn't been

done before and that might be a surprise

and Delight for our audience and maybe

new people as well no I mean Erica from

a business perspective like how what are

some best practices that you know young

designers can use to really shape you

know their brands on social

I think like the the biggest bottom line

is there's no one way for anybody like

you know there's not like one size meets

all everybody has a unique voice and I

think it's tapping into that and what

makes you special and you know yourself

better than anybody else does and I

think it's highlighting that and I think

once you know what that is and once you

know what resonates with your audience

and just staying true to yourself

that makes much stronger I would say

best practice by each platform and again

like each platform has a different type

of audience so you know Facebook is

generally an older

demographic uh Snapchat very young uh

Instagram is probably a millennial like

myself

and then Tick Tock you know that's where

you can have a lot of fun so I think

everybody is on Tech talk but

um it's it's all it's all up to you

I mean do you guys see a big difference

in terms of your follower groups based

on the platform

yeah I feel like even with the platforms

I don't know if any of you guys feel

like this but I definitely feel like I

also have like different Vibes for each

platform like when I think about my

Instagram it's kind of like put together

a little bit more but my Tick Tock just

seems like I show my personality a bit

more just like I would on YouTube so I

think it's just definitely also learning

the platform and the audience that's on

the platform for you to be able to

really just

be who you are on there but I I've

noticed that with the new platforms that

I have been

um on that I kind of like I'm a little

more particular like okay maybe I

shouldn't post that on Instagram but

like it's totally okay for me to put it

on put it on Tick Tock

um but I think it's just learning that

specific platform I think that's like

key too is that content on a certain

platform does not belong across the

board so it's being very specific to

each audience and each platform and I've

noticed too even with when I when I

tried to like it's great to recycle

obviously your content and everything

because you want to be able to to do

that but anytime I post something on

Tick Tock it makes sense but then the

moment I post it on Instagram everyone's

kind of like oh what is this or why did

you post that or it's like a little

cringy or like it just you have to learn

the platform that you're do you find

that Instagram's like more curated and

it's just more like you want it to look

perfect yeah as opposed to like on Tick

Tock like I can wake up without makeup

on my YouTube I can wake up I feel like

it's pivoting though yeah it's first

pivoting a little bit more

in order for it to still continue to be

a good platform I feel like they're

starting to now be a little bit more

like okay like I'm starting to

understand it but I personally because

I've been doing it for so long I feel

like that transition has been a little

bit more harder for me for me to just

actually

uh me not cringe what I'm looking at I'm

like okay maybe I shouldn't but just

learning the platforms and just actually

knowing what you're wanting to do in

each one because at the end of the day

they're also different I don't know like

it's like a different audience too that

you're kind of gravitating towards right

I mean one of the things I love about

your content is that your entire family

is there and some they sneak peek in

some of the content how do you navigate

that I mean my whole life has been on

social media might be a little bit

different from your guys's experience

but I've started and I share everything

and I feel like that's been a little

harder for me to transition because I'm

not just a brand I'm kind of like you

know I had a lot of my audience based

off of showing everything you know like

I've showed mom life I've showed my

struggles I've shown like it's been very

raw I don't do a lot of the perfect

editing or anything like that so

navigating it's more difficult back to

her with the mental health stuff just

having people have too many opinions

sometimes because

you can talk about me or like have an

opinion about me but then you know how

she was mentioning about her mom like

sometimes they don't understand that

what comes with everything you know like

I can pose my husband and then now he's

involved in something that he didn't ask

for you know like he didn't ask to be on

that platform but

um I mean it's been great too though

because I feel like I have a genuine you

know relationship with all of the people

who support me like whenever I do

anything I know that they're looking at

me they're like oh my God I'm genuinely

so proud of you because they've watched

me grow from you know 20 years old to

where I'm at now I'm gonna talk about

each but where I'm at now and all the

years and all the growth has been

amazing but it just it comes with a lot

for sure wow I mean how do all of you

guys balance that sort of connection

with your followers because they are

very invested they follow you you know

through the years they know the ins and

outs of your career in your life like

what is that aspect of being on social

like

I mean I think I'm I'm pretty authentic

online but it's probably just 20 of who

I am privately I think it's important

for me to keep a line like I I love to

show what I do at work I love to show a

lot of like what my life entails yet my

private life for me that has been like

unless somebody has decided to be in

Social like my husband is on a social so

I feel comfortable with him the friends

I have that is on a social feel

comfortable with them but

I just know my friend group and my

family from home haven't decided so for

me that's my line and like for me that's

not my mitigation but it's different for

everybody and I also think I mean I know

because both me and my husband and

social that day where kids come along

that's also going to be a conversation

do you share that do you not and then

where is that line they can't really

answer and I think you you know best as

a parent what works for you and your

family but yeah I think it's it's

important to or it's been for me to have

days where I'm just like not in like

content creator or I'm just me

well you get to choose you know I think

that's what's the great part about the

platform is that you get to choose what

you want to show and you know

I mean like my natural state is to

always pull out my phone and capture

things but it's deciding is this

something that everybody needs to see or

is it something that I just want to

remember myself

I feel like that with with a lot of the

stuff that I do too I feel like I've

always tried to be very

to just the makeup and the fashion as

well though whenever I do posts like you

hardly actually will see any like actual

mom content like I don't do like the mom

vlogging and the mom you know I post my

kids occasionally but

it's that barrier of I don't want

opinions on how I'm parenting or how I'm

raising my kids or how like because I

feel like that's just a different

conversation but just trying to balance

to make sure that people don't forget

how I started like what led me to where

I'm at now and it was usually it was the

Beauty and the fashion stuff

now I know that you guys didn't

necessarily start out with the goal of

growing followers but tell me a little

bit about how once you really sort of

you know stepped into okay I'm going to

turn this into an actual business how

did you go about sort of building an

audience and growing that audience

I think like it all starts with you know

asking your audience what do they want

to see so you know the audience starts

small no matter what you have to start

somewhere no matter what

um and then as you see more people

following you're like okay well I think

I understand what my audience likes

sometimes they won't like something and

that's okay and you can pivot from that

and you can learn from that and that's I

think that's the key is just

continuously learning and your audience

also continuously evolves so it's just

growing and evolving with your audience

and making sure that you're staying true

to your brand and making sure that like

whatever piece of content that you're

creating actually accentuates what

you're trying to you know give out

I was doing a lot of cross promotion

with um you know other influencers and

bloggers and Brands I feel like that

really helped me grow a following like

just you know my friends who were doing

the same things as me and like-minded

individuals we were you know traveling

together shooting together and doing all

that kinds of stuff so I felt like that

really helped my following grow a lot in

an organic way I also find that works

with Brands like yeah like I feel like

when you collaborate with other brands

or just like cross mode lift each other

up and like if you find like-minded

Brands doing like collaborations makes a

lot of sense or even just like

have an event or do something together

or like yeah share each other highlight

yeah yeah it helps a lot

no each of you is a brand owner when it

came time to you know

launch your Brands how did you go about

developing the social strategy

like with JoJo when it was time for

launch like what was the

um

you know initial social strategy and how

has that evolved over time we actually

created the social platform way before

we created a brand we were a fitness

Community just sharing that we were

working out me and my best friend and

just like sharing like the commitment of

having someone to be in the gym with you

because for me that's always the hardest

part is feeling like motivated so having

someone else who are like accountable

really helped and that we shared that

and we shared partner workouts and

realized oh people also like to have

accountability and like they found other

people and then we were a social media

platform for

three or four years before we build a

brand and it actually was like oh here

might be something and the community

asked for stuff so we're like oh we

could turn this into a bread

what was really hard was like how do you

then take that Community turn into a

brand without fully forgetting the

community but also knowing like hey we

are also a shoppable brand now we aren't

just like the social media platform so

that was that's something we're still

learning every day and like each

campaign is new and different and we're

pivoting constantly different like my

partner just gave birth three weeks ago

so that is also like a whole new chapter

we're adding on to the social media

platform and just like

you know having a partner and everything

has been super super helpful but yeah no

I think for us it was

showing more of the brand taking people

behind the scenes and then taking the

experience we've had in the industry of

like and finding other brands we love

what they do feel inspired love

Pinterest

um to get inspiration from mood boards

and campaigns and shooting and just it

was also really really fun to be the

creative director of shoots instead of

being in front of their camera so but

being behind the camera while I was

hoping to find it was really challenging

but also super creative and yeah every

day every campaign is different every

because we're still constantly a market

that that's the fun thing about social

media you can really test the waters you

like I said our first campaign came out

way too young and way too like

happy-go-lucky and we're like oh that's

not what they want but that was kind of

what our social media present has been

so realizing okay we're turning into a

little bit more fashion we need a

different more mature concept but on how

do we translate that in with our

community so we're still testing the

waters we've only been out for a year

with the brand

yeah I think with Leo is definitely also

who's who you're trying to Target

um I know with like my cosmetic brand it

was a little bit more fun more flirty I

was trying to Target a specific age

group so I feel like that reflected on

what my social media platform was going

to look like and then as far as like

active faith our clothing brand it was a

little bit more edgy it was a little bit

more mature so it's definitely who we

were trying to Target for the actual

brand

um and also separating myself I feel

like I as you know the person like I can

sit there and and create something that

I think would be great because it's me

but I have to put myself outside of the

box of like who the consumer is and

who's actually going to be purchasing my

brand so that's kind of what strategy we

use

um I was traveling and working with

revolve for a really long time and my

content was very heavily swimmer focused

um so when I started my swimwear brand I

was like okay I want the girl who is

shopping for my brand the one who's

gonna shop on revolve and like my

inspiration was you know just traveling

and like everything like that so I feel

like I got a ton of inspiration from

revolve and now my brand is on revolve

so my social strategy was that

and on the least fun side but coming

into any brand I like to look at the

data because the data is what's going to

really drive and give you an

understanding of you know who your

audience is what kind of content is

performing well what's not performing

well

um and then once you kind of know like

the age group and who they are you can

create that kind of content and like

really shape that strategy of what

you're trying to accomplish

now are you guys

working with a social media manager or

is it are you still doing everything on

your own how does that aspect of things

work because a lot of times I think

people feel that especially some social

media is so personal they have to do

everything themselves so I'm kind of

curious

which

you guys are doing at this moment I'm

still heavily involved in every single

aspect of everything that's coming out

but I do have my team for each brand

just because when you are a brand

yourself as

the influencer the content creator it's

really hard to navigate every single

business or every single

um Instagram every single post but

everything still does get verified

through me but I had to unfortunately

get to a point where you have to let you

know people just help and that was also

something yeah like that was also

something very hard because I feel like

I'm always very like this needs to look

like this or because I know what I want

I want it I know what I want it to look

like I know what the vision is but

sometimes you have to step back and just

let the people who are meant to do the

job do the job I'm still doing mine mine

I'm still doing Natasha swim we will be

pivoting to a social media manager but I

am in control of the Instagram and

everything right now it is becoming very

overwhelming so it's also just finding

the right person that you know works

with you and that can see your vision

and art it's it's really hard

um so yeah I'm doing finding somebody

who actually has love for your brand the

way that you do it's it's that's the

hard part for sure I think that's

certainly key is like the love and the

passion

um just like coming in and like

understanding okay you know it's not

okay I'll just go back a little bit too

social media managers we do everything

so like what what don't we do like you

know

um you know influencers too but like in

the sense of where content creators we

um pull data we you know analyze we make

sure that you know whatever we're

producing actually like makes sense for

the feed

um and then we're taking all that data

we're like all right maybe it didn't

work and then we're like okay well hey

by the way like what do you think about

this piece of content that we have to

pitch you and say hey like is this

something that you think would work on

your feed so

yeah we have to be a little bit of a

jack of all trades I think when you're

and I've noticed too even when I did

take that step back to just kind of

allow people to help my brand definitely

elevate it a lot more because I was so

stuck on wanting things to be done a

certain way that even you don't realize

that by trying to do everything you're

not allowing your brand to grow because

you're just stopping yourself from the

full potential that it could be because

now I have a team who's like oh what do

you think about this what do you think

if we drop this and it just feels nice

to be able to walk in and be like okay I

have ideas I have a strategy and it took

some time though I mean I've had my

brands for quite some time now but

um when you do take that step I I did

notice that it was a big change

um I mean we'll I have maybe like three

or four years I feel like that first

first first or two years yeah I'm in my

first two years yeah you're not gonna

want anybody's opinion or you you know

what your brand is you know what you

what you want for your brand but then

after that it was I have you know I have

three brands so it was so overwhelming

for me to one still be a mom of my third

baby so I'm a wife like it was just a

lot of

to focus on my brand I wasn't giving it

the full attention it deserved and

that's when I felt like I was just being

a little selfish I wasn't allowing

myself to let the brand grow because I

was so stuck with wanting it hard to

balance all of that another thing

there's a huge difference in like my

personal Instagrams which is also kind

of a brand itself that I control but

with JoJo our fitness brand which is not

just mine it's me and my partners we

definitely got someone involved actually

one of our friend who's been she was

actually kind of evolved early on just a

fan of us and like

in the sense of just like always would

work out with us over uh the pandemic

she would help us a lot would you say

coming up with Concept because she's

such a creative like wait you should

come work because you can't just like

have fun with us like we should pay you

to do this

um so that has been super nice to be

able to like hand it over to someone we

fully trust but we still meet like we

still shoot all the content

she gets in she creates it she

represents it back so it's still heavily

involved and like all that stuff but for

me it's you can't physically

do everything and the hardest part is to

let go and ask for help do you feel like

that's also made you stronger and your

brand stronger too by having that help

and leveraging those people it grew up

Brands so much I mean we were kind of

like stuck in that just having someone

coming in with fresh ideas someone

coming in and like because you have to

be so consistent we had to be so

consistent in our own platforms so

sometimes the neglect came to our brand

because oh which one of us just posted

last night or didn't we so now having

someone who makes sure that the content

comes out like daily on time even if

we're in a plane or somewhere

um

at least took the stress away from the

brand our own personal things it's like

a whole different story but when it

comes to the brand

you can't afford

not being on it

100 and I also don't do it alone either

so I have a I have an amazing team so

shout out to the team who helps us

curate all this amazing content

nope how do you measure success what is

success was social media posts mean to

you is it something that gets high

engagement is it something that you feel

resonates with your followers

just on a personal level how do you

define success

it's more of an overall I think it's

hard to save one single post successful

I mean sometimes as a brand you can see

a straight correlation on your Shopify

with a post and actually like what comes

in that feels super successful but

I think relying on each post to feel

like oh that's measurement success it's

gonna

tear you down yeah I think you have to

look at the overall picture I think you

have to look at the long picture and

this is especially when it comes to

brands that are like company You're

Building or if you're designing you want

a new brand out there

it's not an overnight thing like as much

as things look like overnight successes

and like you can go viral on Tick Tock

nowadays and all these things

but it doesn't mean longevity so for me

it's like it's a consistency a constant

going at it and just being like okay

what is the time frame I'm giving myself

okay I'm I am going to commit the next

next X amount of years to do this

because if I think it's just gonna

happen tomorrow you might be very

disappointed

I mean I think success is different for

everybody

um there isn't like I said before one

size fits all like some of us might be

looking for engagement some of us might

be looking for virality which again not

that easy even though it may look like

that

um there's a lot that goes into it

um some might just

want to be up there you know just the

small goals like you know starting from

scratch and getting yourself out there

is huge

um but yeah like honestly like it's

setting those goals and then looking at

it day to day and not going okay oh I'm

not I don't have a million followers or

I don't have like this much engagement

as I want what you have to start

somewhere so like you grow that audience

and you grow that like passionate

audience I think that's where you find

your success especially those where

they're constantly cheering you on I've

seen like a lot of Brands and a lot of

people like grow from small to large

like you know I followed your brand as

well and it's been amazing to see like

where you got where where you Blossom

too like it's huge so it's having that

like audience that supports you and

being authentic to yourself and

authentic to your brand and you're

eventually gonna

get where you want to be yeah I feel

like success for me is just having the

consistency of you know incoming jobs

coming in working with different brands

that I have on my brand like wish list

and stuff and not necessarily like

engagement or following or anything like

that and then you know my my own brand

evolved so I think if I'm like

constantly feeling like I'm growing

Within Myself and I'm getting consistent

work and you know involving with myself

I I feel like that's success and just

starting it in general like taking that

step to actually start the business and

do what you're doing yeah after it yeah

and going after it because I feel like

that everyone's gonna have their own uh

definition to what success is and going

in trying to compare your success with

someone else's it's only going to

that's like the last thing you should do

it's not worth it not just like looking

at yourself and seeing how you're like

not comparing yourself to yourself but

seeing that you're like the feeling that

you're like growing like taking the

initiative starting the business and

posting your first picture and doing

your first campaign like all that's just

going to be evolving to overall success

of what you're trying to accomplish I

mean honestly it takes guts to start so

if you started you're successful

definitely now to that end like what

have been some of your proudest moments

or biggest Milestones that you've

reached in your careers that either came

via social or you know were involving

social

[Music]

okay

um I think for me I mean taking a social

platform that was just a fun idea to

working out and sharing that and like

the day we sat with our first product

like we hadn't even set it out but just

sitting with that product actually like

at the 3pl fully packed and like was

ready to like the first order you know

sending it out and like we were building

most of the brand and like my partner's

kitchen so it's just like sitting there

and folding and that sitting once you go

live you're just like is anyone going to

care and that first order comes in

you're like

that was a crazy high feeling or even

just like when you have your customer

receive their first package and they are

reviewing it and it's great feedback and

it's every all that hard work it's like

the smallest details if they just

noticing like your packaging or like all

those little things just having that

moment of having the consumer being like

Oh my God this is the best thing ever I

love it or I'm obsessed it's like you

know that it was worth all the stress

all the anxiety and yeah like seeing the

hard work you know seeing the people

like in in my brand in my swimwear it

was just like wow people you know I was

just always kind of self-conscious like

are people gonna like it like you know

are they gonna see what I see so I think

just seeing other influencers bloggers

customers everybody you know in the

brand and then seeing it Grow from there

was just very

filling

yeah I think like the bottom line though

even more than just growth is just the

sentiment like if you're seeing that

everyone's like loving what you're doing

then I think that's a win yeah

now what's the biggest challenge of

having a fashion business in 2023

oh the biggest challenge of having a in

having a fashion business in 2023 as a

business owner like what would you say

is

the hardest thing of doing it right now

um for us maybe trying to stand out I

feel like that's been

kind of a little bit of trying to make

sure that you're doing something a

little bit different or you know your

target at the end of the day we're all

targeting you know a lot of the same

people it's just what's gonna set you

apart from everything else

I think for me the most uh well for us

the most challenging I'm based in Miami

and the manufacturers are here in LA and

we've had like a ton of delays with

production and stuff you know from

overseas so that's been really

challenging for me and my brand was

developed all over zoom and all over the

Internet so yeah that's just been very

difficult for me

I mean there's I mean a lot of what they

said as well but I also think

being um the world is so connected and

social media is so worldwide and you

want to be a brand for everybody and the

whole world but we're also shipping out

of LA right now and like so when a

customer calls hey I ordered to Europe

what is bad and I'm like oh you know

that thing to get it out custom

um and that's something you can't

predict you could put on your website

but each country is so different so

realizing that people actually don't

read the small letters they don't

research a lot of things and it's on you

but just taking it day by day and like

try not grow bigger than you are I think

it's like holding back because I'm not

sure like with being creative it's so

fun like I mean we have mood boards for

the next 10 years and I was like oh my

God I want to do this this and this and

this and you almost like already over

the collection that's coming out because

you've already designed like two three

next and you're like but that's the new

baby that's a shiny toy

but taking it one step at a time letting

things develop I think the hardest part

is like patience because we all come

from like instant gratification kind of

like lifestyle with likes and social

media or a job that's out tomorrow and

knowing that like a business that's a

slow thing yeah and it even takes time

for the customers to you know start

buying your brand and I thought

instantly like you know I'm like why

isn't anybody buying anything but it it

took some time and yeah having the

patience is super key and also just the

overall how long it takes to create a

product and create an actual piece was

something that was really shocking for

me in the beginning too where I think we

all assume like oh it's going to be a

quick process but it's like years and

like even with the Cosmetic side of it

it takes like two to three years for me

to be able to actually perfect like a

makeup palette and then when you launch

it you're just kind of like okay it's

all so quick when you're launching and

you're doing that fun part but the

creating process is very time consuming

like when you're doing like we do

everything cut and so so everything is

from scratch and it takes two years for

us to even make like a crop top you know

like it's very time consuming and the

fits the fit yes it goes through like

three four rounds of fitting to make

sure if it's all body types and

everything's inclusive and it's it's a

lot yeah the designing for women is

definitely like a whole different ball

game than designing for a lot of things

because there's so many different

versions of us not one of us is the same

but that's also what's so beautiful

about it and I also think realizing that

not every product you make is for

everybody but making sure your overall

brand has something to offer for most

people

I mean one of the things I think is

really interesting is that everybody is

on social media but there are still so

many misconceptions about it what would

you guys say is just the biggest

misconception that you've encountered

in your careers about social media

probably back to the fact that if you

work with social media and it's like

your main platform for income except

that it's not a real job real job yep

sometimes don't really feel like because

like you're so used to like the nine to

five yeah right conversation or that

it's easy that you know it's it's a fast

process that anybody can just kind of

when everybody couldn't do it but it's

like who's gonna be the person that

actually

does it and is being consistent and

taking the time like it's very very time

consuming but it's also the fact that

they think it just it was it just

happens you know yeah no one really

understands like what really goes into

every campaign that we build out every

single one of us and how much work just

goes into one post you know they think

oh you just take a picture and you write

something right that that's all it is

right

very time consuming

now

obviously you've all been in fashion for

some time now what would you say is the

biggest change that you've seen in the

fashion industry since you started

I mean now we're going 12 years back so

fashion was very separated like high

fashion if you talk to fashion houses

there was they were separated for the

more commercial Brands to it was very

like

elitist in a way of like what part of

the circus you were allowed to be part

of whereas social media has kind of

opened the door for the mix of

everything it's opened the door that

they allow every different kind of

person inside but also the brands are

mixing nothing is so out of touch

anymore which I really appreciate and

allowing everybody to just be very

creative to their own style you know I

feel like we all had a vision of what

fashion was supposed to look like and

now everyone can kind of have their own

version of what fashion really is

yeah I feel like just the being

relatable like fashion is so relatable

now we're as opposed to like 10 years

ago it wasn't because it was just

looking into magazines and stuff so I

love the diversity in it now

I mean now you can see yourself on there

before it was like whatever they told

you that you were supposed to see so now

you can see different body types and

different personalities

everyone it's so much more inclusive

it's the door is wide open anyone can be

a part of this industry now and that's

the wonderful thing now

when it comes to social I feel like

everyone has had their faux pas moment

their moment the thing that they wish

they hadn't posted or the thing that

they wish they had posted but they

didn't do it please tell me if there's

one moment that you guys remember where

it didn't go right where there was a

mistake made where you know you wish you

could go back and tell

yourself in the past you know the

lessons that you learned from that

moment

um with me I feel like in the beginning

it was hard understanding why it wasn't

happening so quickly

um and I guess still continuing to try

even though it wasn't happening as fast

as maybe it was happening for somebody

else or

um but looking back I feel like I'm

actually grateful that it wasn't such a

quick transition because I feel like

sometimes when things happen so quickly

you don't know how to handle or how to

what to do with the platform like it

would have happened really quick for me

like what what if I what would I have

done would I have been like oh my God

like how do I react to this or do I

create a brand do I not I feel like that

slow process of growth really helped me

figure out what I wanted to do as a

brand and what I wanted to come out with

and just give me that time to really

know what I wanted to put out

I mean like whenever you post anything

you really don't know how people are

going to react you're kind of like

taking a chance so we whenever we post

anything from either my personal or from

the brand side we're kind of testing to

see you know what how people are going

to respond and you you learn from it and

it's okay if you fail it's okay if

sometimes we post something that oop

we're not it wasn't supposed to do that

we sorry

um but it's just how how do you grow

from that and like how do you turn it

around so like what is your response and

I think that's like

and not picking up for sure I feel like

that's like a lot of us kind of will be

like oh I didn't do so good maybe I I

shouldn't have done that and just try

again you know maybe he wasn't at the

time at that moment

I feel like social's still changing and

still evolving what's keeping you guys

excited about it right now what are you

enjoying in the field at present

think how quickly you can Target

audiences now I feel like even just with

Tick Tock it was like a big eye-opener

of how fast like you can Target you know

a million people overnight

um it's just nice to see like just

different platforms and seeing how

everyone is now having an opportunity

and a chance I feel like within we're

going back to like that first like

YouTube Instagram era in the beginning

now with Tick Tock and it's it's been

kind of nice to like notice the

difference with that platform

I find that just like social media in

general it's just like because it like

you said it evolves so much it keeps

things so interesting I'm never bored

like every single day there's something

different popping up and I'm like oh

well let's try that so I think like just

that's something you can't really say

even about like most people's day to

days like you open any of the apps and

discover something new I do like how raw

it is turning into because I feel like I

started out with it being very like

curated and perfect pictures and had to

look like you know magazine style photos

but I like love that it's just becoming

like a little bit more raw and relatable

I like love that I also like that

there's a lot of humor to it yes like

I'm definitely personally very

entertained when I'm on social

um and I think it's really cool to see

people again

just having a fun time with the

platforms

and you're also seeing who's behind the

brand I feel like that's also been very

important you used to support brands

that you didn't know who the Creator was

or you didn't know who was behind the

brand and now that we have the platform

to be able to show and who you're

actually supporting and who's behind

what you're purchasing and where you're

spending your money I feel like it's

it's been really really nice to be able

to see that I think that's a great call

out because before it was like oh these

are the photos this is the brand now you

get to actually see like who is behind

the brand who's like putting all this

together and there's a good amount of

people

now what do you guys consider good

engaging content like who do you guys

think is doing it right

so anyone you guys follow that you think

is just great

there's a lot of people who do it really

right and I think people are doing it

for so many different reasons like it

also comes down to are you fall like is

it people you're just fans of like

personally yeah or is it people you're

like you're in my other brands I'm not

asking them I'm like saying there's so

many different versions of it and like I

am extremely fascinated about people in

Tick Tock because that's something I'm

still learning it's such a new platform

no it's not new but it still feels like

ever evolving where the voices of tick

tock is just you always get it changes

weekly it's so opposite from what you

were like told yeah social media my

whole career I've been a 2D image now

all of a sudden I have to talk to the

camera like be pressing the hole that's

like intimidating in a different way but

it's fun and like I just I love how like

like I think I would have loved it when

I went to high school and just like quit

Dancing I used to do that in front of my

webcam

recording just to the computer but

having a platform like Tick Tock it's

been really interesting to see that the

youth actually like going out with it

and then I love how like open and

political it is as well that it's not

just but there's actually like a social

awareness that's changed and I feel like

that was missing for me with social

media it felt like a for for a hot

second it felt like a place for people

just judged and stuff but now people are

actually using it to communicate with

the rest of the world and that's where I

feel like it's super fascinating because

the world has gotten so open and we're

not allowing things to just happen the

same way anymore

I think also with like the brands that

you might be thinking are doing it the

right way it's just really taking what

you can from every single brand that you

may follow or that you may really like

in making that in like you being

actually inspired and wanting to

incorporate that into your brand instead

of just thinking that they're doing it

the specific the same like the right way

and it's the only way you know just

taking little bits and pieces from like

you know people that you do following

scene like okay that's working for them

like maybe I can incorporate that into

my brand or you know vice versa

I mean I think it's totally subjective

too like you know we all follow specific

people or specific Brands and things

that we want to emulate or maybe there's

something that like you said like humor

you know that's that's something that we

didn't feel okay posting about before

and now we can be so um unscripted and I

think there's something to be said about

that

absolutely now what are you guys excited

for next in terms of your Brands what do

you guys most sort of looking forward to

for the rest of 2023

[Music]

mine is pretty mapped out I'm just

excited for the collections to come out

um we're already talking 2024 because

production takes so freaking long to

like make and happen and even then we

feel like we're behind most things but

no I think it's just exciting to

constantly grow and constantly be part

of seeing what the world evolves into

and but also see like we definitely know

that there's constantly new social media

platforms showing up I mean AI is

becoming a huge thing so it's going to

be interesting to see how that like

changes everything and what it does for

design what it does for how we

communicate and yeah we're definitely

keeping it close eye on AI and trying to

like navigate with that whole situation

is

that is a scary situation scary but also

a promising and it's weird chat gbt

anyone no I haven't tried it I tried to

make it safe do my caption and I was

like this is so cheesy it's like

captions for backing like

2013 Instagram I'm like nah okay we're

not there yet we can't be replaced yet

oh um I think for me I was really

focusing on direct to Consumer and this

year for 2023 I'm really trying to get

the brand into different e-commerce

websites and different retailers so

that's what I'm really looking forward

to this year and focusing on as opposed

to well obviously direct consumer but

definitely other e-commerce websites

different retailers so I'm really

excited about that just the overall

growth I feel like we've accomplished so

much in these past couple years so just

seeing how much more and what limits we

can really push ourselves to really

Elevate the brands

and then on the Shannon side I'm just so

excited to grow up my team and we have

so many amazing campaigns coming I'm

excited for all of you guys to see it so

okay well I think we are fast

approaching time I don't know if anybody

has a word of advice for the young

designers in the room in five seconds

but if there is if you're not on social

get on social

don't don't be afraid that's okay take

advantage of you know being able to be

on the platform and use it to your

advantage like really just jump on there

if you're thinking about it don't think

about it and just do it never give up

just keep going literally you'll be

broken down so many different times but

that was always pushing me to go further

and even if you fail you're going to

learn from it honestly like failing is

good

okay thank you guys so much please
