soba has an angular jawline

so those of you blessed with a clear

sharp jawline like soha nothing lets you

flaunt it more than a clean

shaven here's my secret ability of

choice when clean shaving don't just

pick up any trimmer and put it on zero

length setting that's lazy so is about

precision and playing soba is not easy

so pick up an ability you love for a

lifetime

see the difference the chilled fusion

proglide razor is smooth it cannot cut

you and you just feel so fresh and ready

for the game

there is none of that last minute

irritating stubble left behind on your

face and believe me this has more

benefits than you can imagine

[Music]

you
