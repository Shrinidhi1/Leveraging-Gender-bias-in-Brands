- [Narrator] It is overwhelming

trying to prepare for a date,

especially if it's your first one.

You want everything to
be perfect and special.

However, a lot of guys are still not sure

about how to get ready for
a date, but don't worry,

we're here to show you

how to get that perfect look on your date.

First things first, you
should look presentable,

for that, you need to
pay attention to grooming

and that's step number one, grooming.

Your face says a lot about you

so pay attention to your
hairstyles and facial hair.

Facial hair is very important,

a patchy beard can be
a deal-breaker for you.

With a properly groomed look,
you can make an impression.

You can use the Gillette SkinGuard Razor,

specifically designed to protect you

from sensitive skin and razor bumps.

Wash your face with lukewarm water.

Apply the shaving gel
and shave your beard.

The Gillette SkinGuard Razor

shaves your hair without
touching your skin,

giving you a comfortable shave.

If you want to sport a beard,

make sure you trim it
and shape it properly.

An unkempt beard gives you a shabby look.

Make sure you wash your hair and style it

using a gel or wax.

Ensure your hair isn't out of place

or overgrown from one side

as it could look very messy.

Visit the salon for a
trendy haircut if required.

The next step is clothes.

Typically, a fitted silhouette
where your clothes hug,

but not constrict your
body is the way to go.

Look for items like a
tailored dinner jacket,

a straight-leg jeans, or
a slim button-down shirt.

It's all about wearing the clothes

versus letting the clothes wear you.

It also depends if you're going
on a lunch date or a dinner.

For a lunch date, choose
light-colored shirts,

whereas you could go for
brighter colors on a dinner date.

When it comes to trousers, you
can go for chinos or denims,

but avoid ripped or torn jeans

as they could be deal-breakers.

Do consider wearing something comfortable

because you don't want
to end up looking clumsy.

Tip number three, shoes.

Pick a pair of good-looking shoes.

Loafers are ideal for a date,

but you could experiment
with a pair of sneakers too.

And there you go.

Now you have all the tips and tricks

to look good on your date.
