Chapter 5 Coco


Once upon a time...

There was a little girl who
concealed her humble origin all her life and

decided to create her own legend

Once upon a time...

There was a girl
named Gabrielle Chanel whose

father was a small businessman who wandered around

My mother was unable to do laundry for a
living, and died at the age of 32.



There was a father
who abandoned his five children

and sent three of his daughters to an orphanage.

12-year-old Gabriel never saw him again

Since then,
she has been pretending that her father went to America

Once upon a time... There was an orphanage

within the walls of the Abbey of Obasin,


where Gabriel lived for nearly seven years.

This simple Roman-style ascetic world

created  Her austere style

and preference for black and white were inspired by the

ornateness of religious clothing and ceremonial objects, which inspired

her fascination with baroque

gold and colored gemstones for decades to come.

Once upon a time...

There was a beautiful girl who
sewed by day  Making clothes Performing

in the restaurant at night

Singing for the cavalry officer

People call her "Coco"

because she always sings that
"Who saw Coco then?"

She likes to pretend that Coco is a nickname her father gave her

Once upon a time...

There is a charming boyish young woman who

refuses to ride sideways like other ladies

even if the horse is the well-born cavalry officer
Ã‰tienne Balleson

Her clothes are also unique.

She drew inspiration from men's clothing

and invented a new style of women's hat. She
removed all the bird feathers on the hat to

make it simpler, lighter and more fashionable.

Her earliest customers were just ordinary occupations.  Women,
however, the high society soon flocked to

the past...

There was someone she once loved deeply, and
that was Capel boy.

He was British, rich, well-bred,

just the man of her dreams.

He introduced her to literature, the Orient  And mysticism

Capel boys help Coco become Chanel

She chooses to start her design career in Paris, Deauvier and Biarritz



She wants to win freedom and independence through work

Once upon a time...

Coco Chanel's magic touch

changed the way of women's clothing  The silhouette has

since sparked a fashion revolution.

She has cut her skirts to reveal ankle lengths,



liberated her waist,

discarded her corsets and
reinvigorated sportswear with jersey knits.

She also cut her hair short and got a tan.

Chanel ended an old era,  A
New Era In Fashion

Once upon a time...

In 1918,

Madame Chanel opened
her first boutique in Paris at 31 rue Cambon

A country girl from Auvergne

An orphan from the Abbey of Aubasin,
became  Queen of Paris

Before she liberated women, she liberated herself

Once upon a time...

There was a love story that ended abruptly The

Capel boy was killed in a car accident Coco

Chanel, for the first
and last time, cried in public

"Either he  Go,
or go alone to complete the cause we have created together"

She chose to face it with strength, going forward

bravely, to be continued...
