Chapter 16
Camellia

I remember that
Gabrielle Chanel never said

why she had a soft spot for me,

but there are some things that are always self-evident.

I remember that Coco was a
girl when she was 13 years old.  The

stage play deeply moved

me. I remember
Proust and his well-dressed friends

wearing me on the lapel of the coat

to show elegance, harmony and androgynous beauty.

I remember

Coco borrowing designs from men's knitwear and

trousers.

I remember
the day

she had a sudden
inspiration and pinned me to the belt of her Breton striped shirt on the beach of Etretat.






A woman is
free to choose her own scent

I remember
I was so much like her

I bloomed in winter
We were always a season ahead of others

I was forever young
"No matter how the years pass, always charming"

I remember what
Chanel gave me that day

A lady asked her what she had for breakfast and

she replied, "Camellia"










On the chiffon dress,

I remember that
she made me ever-changing, satisfying every whim. Embroidery

, printing, carving, pleating, fringe...

Chiffon, satin, organza, tweed, feather...

I remember the
first time diamonds  Glittering like dew on my flawless petals



I remember
every new creation

Rings, brooches, buckles, necklaces
Long necklaces, watches and pearl chains

I remember
how I bloomed in ceramics, onyx, coral

opal, pearls  On mother-of-pearl, sapphire, ruby

I remember
Karl Lagerfeld

creating the most gorgeous wedding dress with a bouquet of camellias

I remember

how my petals intertwined perfectly to form the double C

I remember
I am not a simple camellia

I am the flower of Chanel
