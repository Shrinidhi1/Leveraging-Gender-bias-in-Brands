foremost I want to hear a little bit

about your Journeys as

a designer in this creative field tell

us a little bit about how everything got

started for you I'll start with you

Kenya

we don't have enough time

um well I am formally trained I went to

college to be a designer

um which I still owe a lot of money in

student loans

um

I am from Norfolk Virginia I went to

college

really

hey girl

that's weird

oh so I went to okay so real let me make

this real fast I was a crazy Rebel kid

in high school I wanted to be pretty I

almost didn't graduate high school I had

to go to a um I had to take either

woodwork or fashion merchandising to

graduate high school of course I took

fashion merchandising

um it was an eye-opener for me my GPA

sucked I barely got into college got

into college had too much fun in college

my mom sent me to Atlanta to go to a

technical school which was no band no

parties or nothing but I still found a

party then I got I learned how to sew

and make patterns and then after that I

thought that I was going to go to New

York and work for Donna Karen and then

the world said no I ended up being a

bartender and then I was bartending and

waiting tables and then I was making

clothes at night and then I was poor and

then my lights will go out and then I

would take the extension cord and when

everyone else asleep and I would plug it

outside of my building because they had

power and I would make clothes because

I'm like I got 800 I'm getting the gun

to buy fabric I'm gonna pay rent and

then I will still pour

and man one it was like and then I had

like this very crazy moment as an adult

when you have to move back home with Mom

and then I had to go to back to Virginia

and then they made me very sad and then

like three months into being in Virginia

um something just said apply for a

Project Runway and I'm like that's

bananas because that show that make no

sense you can't make clothes that

quickly and then I did

and then I messed up the application I

put like monkey pictures and like Mickey

Mouse and then the very next day they

called and they said we want you on the

show and I said why and then

and then they said we think you're great

but please send us some good pictures

and then I made it on the show and I

made it to the top five and then I came

home and then I was poor again and then

I was sleeping on sofas I was literally

sleeping on the floor in my studio and I

was taking showers I mean well bird

baths or whole baths whatever they call

them at the at the local grocery store

at 7 A.M and then I would come back to

my studio like I was never there because

I would sleep on the floor and then life

just kept turning but I never stopped

and I think because I didn't stop and I

kept going uh life keeps showing me all

the great things that it has to offer

okay

foreign

oh my gosh

what is story and Kenya all of that led

you here today yeah amazing thank you so

much for sharing I was here for the ride

I loved it so much and I didn't cry oh

uh of course

we gotta hear Armand tell us about your

career your journey how did you get here

today well my story is way shorter

I have to make it short so I was born

and raised in Albania and I was drawing

and sketching ever since I was five I

went to art school over there and then

my phone I found my way to Dubai I

started working in the fashion industry

as a creative director for different

brands and just because I was doing

fashion illustration on Instagram that's

where she informed me so basically I

don't have a fashion design background

but that's always been something that I

wanted to do so uh yeah I was so so

happy when she when she reached out

because I was always lacking confidence

on not being able to construct my own

designs I was like maybe I'm I cannot be

a designer

but yeah it worked out and you know here

I am so here you are today I love that

story because I feel like a lot of us

can get in our own ways sometimes or if

we absolutely absolutely don't be the

one to tell yourself no ever exactly uh

and of course Valerie we're so happy to

have you here today how did everything

come to be with your career well

um I was actually designing jewelry when

I was in first grade I got in trouble

um I got sent home because the teacher

caught me selling at recess and they're

like you can't sell at school

um so I got sent home and they told my

mom and it was a big deal and so I

couldn't sell my jewelry which I was

really sad

um when I was in third grade I kept

doing it anyways I was like I'm making

money so I am going to keep doing this I

actually bought tickets to Disneyland

when I was in third grade very proud of

myself

um

and yeah similar story to Kenya the

struggle with being a designer

um not having a traditional education

you know being self-taught you know I

took the more punk rock route where I

taught myself everything I took clothes

apart I figured it out on my own I

didn't have guidance I didn't have I

didn't really have like a support

network so in a way you know I had to

carve my own path

um and yeah here I am today you know

just keep writing and the same with you

Kenya you know don't give up you know

the the odds will be against you but you

know just keep pushing through and and

you'll shine

yes absolutely

I love that you were selling jewelry in

first grade that's an iconic story I'm

sorry for that yeah boring a young

business woman

I know you all have participated in

various activities within the she and X

program including our very first 100K

challenge which I don't know if you guys

know we get a super cool design

competition Series where we had uh

different designers mentored by some of

the biggest names in fashion including

Christian siriano uh Jenna lions and

Khloe Kardashian

it was nuts uh what I'd love to hear

from each of you is what would you say

has been the most memorable moment in

your career in the she and X Program so

far or maybe a the most memorable

campaign you've been a part of and I'll

start with you Armand

okay so she next 100K was definitely the

most memorable one because we had like a

month to create the design bring them to

life shoot them and then promote them

and do everything and I enjoyed the

process so much so that was the real

campaign that I was like okay I can I

can do this full time you know I can see

myself doing this and I was super happy

with the results I I was playing with

Prince that's where I started playing

around with Prince and I was like I was

finding my identity as a designer and I

also I was voted I got most votes from

the audience which was amazing

so seeing everybody's feedback and how

people I would see people's feedback

wearing my clothes and they would

comment on the size on the on the

material and how comfortable they are

and yeah that's that's what I wanted

actually so I was I was super happy

amazing amazing and how about you

Valerie okay so it was it was a

challenge like when they said the 100K

challenge challenge yes it was a major

challenge

um one of the most memorable events that

happened actually was

staying up till 4am with Kenya

um something had happened where one of

her pieces from the runway went missing

and she needed to sew another one the

next day and our call time was like at 8

A.M I think so I invited her to sew at

my studio and we stayed up till I would

say like 4 30 and made it happen and she

constructed the jacket we had some help

and showed up 8 A.M the next day half

asleep and yeah pushed through so that

was one of the most memorable moments

actually

was like the bonding and like all of the

contestants were helping each other so

like the comradeship you know was cool

yeah that sounds awesome I love when

like when it comes to it and you got to

work together and you got to make

something happen you you surprise

yourself sometimes with what you can

accomplish yeah absolutely and Kenya

tell us memorable moment campaign

well first of all thank you girl yes of

course

um if any of you have ever had a moment

where you had to create on a dime

and in a moment I'd be so surprised at

what I can do or where my adrenaline

level will take me but I think for me

um

they definitely robbed me of my 100K

um she and y'all owe me some money

it was it was pretty dope and uh she and

please bring it back

um it is so needed

um it will really help take Brands to

the next level please please please

bring it back

[Laughter]

um

it was adrenaline rushing to his point I

mean we had a month we had to make a

collection do a shoot for the collection

like presented again I mean come to La

um I was super psyched because Chris and

siriano was my mentor

and I got to fly to New York and meet

him and hang out with him and it was

pretty dope I'm not gonna lie the 100K

contest is intense is a hundred thousand

headaches but it was intense it was

needed it was it was everything

um it was I think we all agree it was

has to be the most

um the most memorable

um yeah

she in as his dog

I love it I think that's so great that

this was such a special moment for all

of you she stayed up to four o'clock in

the morning to help me make a jacket oh

my gosh yes Round of Applause for that

please

oh my gosh here for that listen we love

the support we love the support uh

speaking of design challenges I mean it

must be tricky coming up with ideas and

getting inspiration for pieces that

you're creating and you're all she Next

Top performers so what I would love to

hear oh yeah take the moment what I

would love to hear is what how do you

get that inspiration to keep your

collections top of mind for seeing

consumers how do you keep things fresh

I'm going to start with you Valerie

well

um I mean we've been Trend setting for a

long time we've been doing this for a

really long time

um and actually we're pretty responsible

for a lot of the trends you see in like

the mainstream Marketplace

um like the baggy style for instance

that blew up

um with Billy that was us we did like

the gender fluid oversized garments and

then that became you know a trend and

then everyone started wearing you know

like the oversized like

pieces so yeah I mean I just think that

we have a natural attack for just

knowing like what's on the Forefront

like what's going to be next so it's

usually off

off the beaten path you know it's

yeah

I know you obviously started being

creative in such a businesswoman at a

very very young age would you say this

is something that that's always come

natural for you yeah actually I mean I

was actually going to school to be a

teacher I was going to be an educator

and so I was just using fashion as like

a side hustle I was like oh it makes me

money like cool people like what I'm

wearing or oh I can make this shirt or

this necklace and I would sell it and

then you know just kept throughout my

whole life through school everywhere I

was just like oh okay I could sell these

shirts I'm making I could sell this

jewelry and so yeah it was just a part

of my journey just growing up

absolutely and Kenya how about you how

do you feel you keep the collections

fresh come up with all of these ideas

each time

I fly to L.A and buy edibles

[Laughter]

um I think I'll pay attention to well

one I pay attention to my audience and I

I'm always asking my audience what do

you like

um if I make this dress will you buy it

do you like this color and that's

important because they are the ones who

are going to buy it and so when working

with qian I'm paying attention to like

who their customer is what she like

what's trending and trying to make like

what I consider to be my classic pieces

without being super trendy because I

don't like things that like go away I

want you to buy something and be able to

wear it all the time in any season and

with your sneakers and your heels and

whatever you want

um so it just really just paying

attention and a lot of it is just

kind of a shot in the dark and you'd be

like oh they like that like okay

he's saying I love the honesty as well

because I know a lot of us were so

curious about this you know we I'm gonna

tell you I don't know how you all do it

I'm so impressed by each one of you and

so I love hearing that process and and

how you come up with these amazing

pieces

um Armand how about you so for me the

strategy I was following when it comes

to designing I never want to be limited

to only one type of woman and one type

of body type

so every time we had one of these

challenges where they designed a

three-piece collection and I want every

type of woman who goes in my site and

sees the collection to find themselves

at least in one of the pieces and I want

to design for different age groups

different bodies different skin tones

of course I follow the trends you know I

keep up with the trends and I try to

like embrace them and put them in my

designs so I guess yeah that's why it's

been working I guess yeah 100

do you feel like you've had to Pivot the

way you designed to cater she in

consumers at all and if so how do you

keep your brand identity throughout

in a way yes because I do love to

interact with people I love to hear the

feedback I love to see what's selling

more what do people like so yeah it's

it's important I mean it's important to

create and come up with amazing pieces

but in the end of the day you have to

think as a businessman as well you know

you you want your pieces to sell so you

want to give the customers what they're

asking for

absolutely Kenya how about you

do you feel like you've had to Pivot uh

your designs at all to cater to she and

customers

um

not really I think I've been able to

stay true to who I am as a brand I think

the most important part of being a

designer is staying true to who I am

it's like that fine line of staying true

to who you are but you're also working

with another brand so trying to also

stay relevant and identify what who

their customer is too but without losing

yourself it can be it can be it can be a

little weird but all I'm gonna do me I'm

gonna do me and hopefully that me doing

me is going to make sense to anybody

who's going to buy it um I am five feet

I am 242 pounds yes that's what I said

um and so it matters to me when I look

at like how to dress like a curvy body

even from desires size 0 to the 20 we

all have like that curve and I want to

make sure that I am making that curve

look as fabulous as possible

yes 100 you got to be cute girl

absolutely I love it I love it and

Valerie how about you do you feel like

you've had to Pivot at all no not at all

actually if anything I feel like it's

been really

um helpful

um because it's offering freak City LA

to a customer base at like a super

affordable price you know I do

everything Hands-On and very custom

wardrobes so if you know like the price

of fashion like it's very expensive you

know doing everything by yourself so the

fact that you know joining she and X

they're able to scale and offer your

products you know at a very affordable

price so that's been really helpful so

we haven't had to Pivot like design wise

if anything it's kind of an extension

yeah very nice I love each of your

different outlooks on this as well I

know we have a lot of creatives in the

audience today and tuning in so

something I find very helpful

um as a creative myself is you know a

lot of the times we think it's such an

easy Road it's super perfect to just get

to the success that you're at and if you

haven't any hurdles you're not going to

get over them because everyone else had

it so much easier so what I would love

to know are what are some of the biggest

struggles you have faced getting into

this career path and how have you

overcome them I'll start with you Kenya

well I could say a whole lot of things

can be hurdles I can say being a five

foot black woman is a hurdle all by

itself but I could also say that

I am one that beyond what what would be

considered a hurdle rather that is who I

am whether that is the money that I have

in my bank account I have identified

that being a fashion designer is who I

am and what my purpose is and because I

have identified that being a fashion

designer who my purpose is and I walk in

that every single day the doors are

going to open because that is the

assignment that has been put on me

now because I believe that I don't have

to go and seek this I I did not reach

out to Xi'an Xi'an has reached out to me

and that's a lot of my brand

Partnerships there's a lot of things

that I feel like when you're doing like

that thing that's yours you don't really

have to fight that hard to get it you

might have to fight a little bit hard to

sustain it but you don't have to fight

hard to get it and I think that for me

um it's kind of

you know what I'm saying like it's just

a natural flow of things I don't believe

in doors closing

um because I always feel like when

something you know what I'm saying when

something closes another one opens

I just feel like what's mine is mine

like yeah you can't you it's nothing you

can do to take it or people say well you

give away so much information I can give

you I can go live every day and let you

see everything that I'm doing but like

you're not gonna do me how I'm gonna do

me

so I don't care to share the information

with you I'm not that gate keeper that's

like oh I'm not going to tell you where

I get my linen from and my zippers you

can have it

What You Gonna Do With It

I can have it but I don't feel like

there are any things I feel like again

like what I'm going to have I'm gonna

have it but my job is to stay consistent

to keep moving to stay true to the

fashion designer that I am and

everything that I want is going to

present itself as long as I keep

traveling down my road is this fashion

designer that I am

yes

absolutely I think that's an amazing way

of looking at it I have to or you're

gonna die being a fashion design is hard

you be broke you'd be like oh my God

where I'm gonna get money from do I buy

fabric do I pay bills like if you just

it'd be decisions yeah for real yeah

all of that where's the wine

Valerie how about you what what are some

of the biggest obstacles you've had to

face

it's about all of that everything Kenya

said you know the struggle is real when

you're an independent designer with no

Capital

um it's really hard you know it might be

glamorous it might look like oh it's

something I want to pursue but it takes

a certain character you know to push

through the struggles because there's

highs and lows it's like a roller

coaster you know you'll have something

that goes viral and then you'll have

moments of you know quiet and you know

it's hard but um you got to make the

struggle look sexy you gotta you know

keep pushing and um the same thing you

know it highs and lows and um

I don't know I just think that you have

to stay true to yourself and for every

no that you get because it's difficult

you know trying to break through into an

industry that's very saturated you know

for every no there's going to be a yes

you know there might be 50 no's but

there might be 10 yeses and the same

thing if you keep doing you and you're

authentic to yourself those doors will

open and opportunities will definitely

greet you and yeah and then everything

will just move forward and push forward

but it's never going to be an easy Road

there will always be obstacles

um you just have to you know know how to

get over the bumps there's always going

to be bumps in the road and it's like no

big deal you know you know what my big

experience is

to know like it's not the no right I'm

used to the no yes but it is what

happens when I stop saying yes to myself

like what's on the other side of that

like I fought so hard to be where I am

and God knows where I'm going right so

but what if I stopped today right like I

can tell you 30 million ways to like

take 20 and what to do with it but what

I don't know is like what does that

yacht look like what does that private

island look like what does retiring my

mama look like and if I stop today I

won't know what that what that means I

don't slept girl let me tell you I slept

on the floor in my studio with my back

hurting and I had a client that's gonna

meet me there at 8 30 so I gotta clean

up go to the grocery store and take a

whole bath and then come back and act

like I just got there when she got there

like no I did all that stuff exactly so

like if I stop now like was it all in

vain

I like my own show girl when you're

talking about bird baths I had an

electric kettle that was my shower that

was my hot shower so sleeping in a

studio we slept in our showroom and

that's how we operated for the longest

time but here we are so it's never in

vain the struggle is never in vain and

you I love I'm going to steal this but

make the struggle look sexy I love that

so much uh Armand how about you

I mean everything you guys said I agree

but I also want to say the biggest

artist that ever existed you know they

always come from a dark place they all

struggle they all had like a difficult

childhood so I think that can easily

become like a source of inspiration and

a source of strength so yeah

but the struggle the biggest struggle

definitely is

um to stand out as a brand

um there's so many Brands every day

somebody is launching something new so

how do you stay relevant to to yourself

and what you do and stay unique while

still standing out and and sell in the

end of the day for me one of the biggest

challenges especially being based in the

Middle East where everything is very

restricted so sometimes that can affect

the creativity as well so you're like

stuck in a box and everything is a don't

so how do you step out of that box

create something that you're proud of

that people are going to like as well so

that has been one of the challenges for

me

thank you so much for sharing uh Armand

looking back at your career path is

there anything you would have done

differently or that you wish you could

do again

um I don't think so I think everything

happens for a reason so I think I've

learned a lot and sometimes I look at

some of my pieces I created a couple

years ago and I'm like what was I

thinking you know but at the time I

thought that was the right thing so yeah

I don't think I would have changed

anything

that's a good answer good answer I I

definitely feel you in the you know

everything happens for a reason mindset

I know how about you Kenya is there

anything looking back at your career you

would have done differently or that you

wish you could do again I would have

hired a CPA from the beginning

um don't overlook the money people they

are your friend their friend they will

help you no I don't think I would change

anything I think that every struggle

hurdle exciting moment sad moment

fantastic moment has um taught me

something that I could take to where I

am in the next my next Journey yeah but

get that CPA and get that attorney for

real

um you need contracts and you need a

money person for real even if it's five

dollars somebody need to show you how to

manage it and that attorney needs to put

a contract on it

good advice as well uh Valerie how about

you

I honestly think I should have taken

fashion a little more seriously because

it was a hustle for me for the longest

time I was like oh making my money on

the side so I would say you know taking

it a little more seriously earlier on

you know because I was going to school

to be an educator and I wanted to teach

so you know maybe I can merge the two

someday you know the fashion and the

education so

absolutely uh something I would love to

know from each one of you uh for anyone

out there trying to get into this career

field whether they're just starting out

in the she and X program or maybe they

haven't even gotten to that point just

yet but they're trying to figure things

out what is one piece of advice you

would offer someone out there watching

I'll start with you Armand

um I mean it's very cliche but just be

yourself

um make your brand speak out for

yourself like for example when I see

each of you girls uh I can see your

brand in you as well I can see it in

your personality I can see it in your

personal style so I think that's

important for you to have your own

unique style and just stick to it but

also

um I feel like starting a brand is just

not about it's not only about creating

you have to do the marketing yourself

you have to do the social media

sometimes and I think that's a that's a

big part as well you have to think as a

businessman and then you have to think

as an artist if you're lucky for

somebody else to do that for you hey but

most of the time that's not that's not

the case so

yeah

and how about you Valerie

definitely I

as a designer and a business you are

wearing so many hats you know and that's

something that I kind of struggle with a

little bit is you know doing the

business and the marketing you know

designing pattern making everything so

I would definitely give advice to you

know delegate things but also first and

foremost keep it real with yourself you

know be authentic tell your story don't

try to be something you're not you know

you you have your own identity and

fashion is an expression an extension of

that so you know just make sure along

your journey that you're just you're

keeping it real and I think that will

take you so far in life if you're just

being authentic like 100 genuine and um

I think that's how you'll stand out in a

Marketplace is just being yourself being

bold being rebellious challenging things

and being disruptive in the fashion

industry and that would be my advice

absolutely I think that's really great

advice and how about you Kenya

um

don't stop uh don't stop and don't stop

again I don't care if you sleeping on

the floor if you're couch surfing if

designing is who you are and is and is

really who

in your gut and you wake up in the

morning and you love it and you cry as

much as I do about fashion don't stop I

don't care what it looks like just

simply don't stop if you don't have a

pattern maker guess what you got the

good will Autumn clothes in there break

them suckers apart lay them down iron

them lay them out flat you just got a

whole pattern shop right there you need

a website developer you need somebody to

do like create you a pitch deck or

whatever Fiverr get it go it's it's ways

to go about all things the barter system

everything but whatever you have to do

make it work but don't stop the

consistency for me is what I feel like

is keeping me going the consistency and

knowing that I can wake up every day and

I feel in my heart of hearts I am really

doing what I am called to do is the one

thing that I can wake up every day and

say that I am filled with gratitude and

I'm grateful for because I am walking

this Earth doing what I think is my

thing and regardless of how much money I

have that it is an emotional experience

for me because I'm excited about that

and it takes and I know it's going to

take me uh to where I need to be but

please don't stop I don't care what nope

my mama

and my grandmother did not understand

nothing about what I was doing they

would see me creating and sewing but

they were like but so and so was hiring

down the street

and I'm like but I don't want to work

their job I would literally rather sleep

in my car I work jobs when I would sit

in the car and I would cry I had a job

and I would go early so I can sit in my

car and cry for 30 minutes get myself

together and then go inside I don't want

that for anybody to want that for myself

I'm not saying quit your job I'm just

saying figure it out give the same

energy that you can give a job give that

to yourself at the same time but please

don't stop don't stop it is worth it the

struggle is worth it the things on the

other side of the struggle is worth it

because you just never know where you

are and then you give up and then you'll

be like man was it all in vain but if I

would have just did it one more time and

then that door will open and that door

will open and that door will open

because for me my grandmother told me at

one time she said

fashion for you is going to be a

Ministry for you it's not just going to

be about the clothes you're going to be

able to tell who you are in your story

to the masses and they're going to say

okay if she can do it a little ball hit

black girl can do it then I can do it

too you know what I mean and it and it

did it is for me it has become what I

consider my Ministry because now we have

a 501c3 day camp for kids that we're

kicking off next year

and

I have another one like because I was

literally the starving artist so like

hopefully by 2024 because we're trying

to find a building we want to create a

residential house for artists and it is

a two-year residency where artists get

to live there totally for free while

they're creating their next project

whether that's a designer rather than

music

it becomes like whatever their art is

and where not only that to bring in

people who are excelling at that to help

them take it to the next level so we can

bring in the next group of people

because I learned it's not just about us

like we have these gifts and these gifts

I suppose and we are supposed to take

these gifts and pour into other people

because it's not I didn't get here and

where I'm going I don't know I'm excited

about where I'm going but I didn't get

here by myself so I know that it's my

responsibility to take someone else with

me and do what I can and I asked all the

time like with the I'm just a little

girl that know how to sew but what can I

do to take that to the next level who

can I enrich who cannot touch what can I

do and that's where all these uh

non-profits came from but the

residential house was important for me

because I'm like if I would have when

you're trying to create and you broke

them designs don't come together

you can't think that skirt is just not

cute enough when the lights is out

and so to give creators that space but

um

I'm just excited I'm just happy to be

here y'all

well we are so excited to have all of

you and also such great advice all

around so thank you so much for sharing

I know I feel very inspired

um each of you have built your own

Brands and I know a lot of us out here

are trying to build our own brand so

what what would you say is important

when building one's brand I'm gonna

start with you Armand

uh I think I mentioned it before as well

it's just uh the identity of the brand

is just about uh you speaking out to the

customers and you staying unique to

yourself and creating my brand is still

evolving I'm still trying to figure out

myself I'm still trying to shape up my

brand and give it some identity so I'm

still learning uh and when I'm ready I

I'm gonna know I'm I'm gonna know I'm

I'm ready to just start my own brand so

yeah very nice thank you and Valerie how

about you I'm totally agree like as you

move along this process you're

constantly learning you know what's

important to your brand I feel like you

have to really pay attention

um to feedback you know from your

customers what they want

um but also again going back to being

authentic to your own style your own

unique identity

and that will extend all the way to you

know the customers you have it's like a

magnet your identity becomes a magnet

for other people that identify with your

story with your brand your creativity so

as long as you're speaking truthfully

you know from your own experience I feel

like that will resonate with other

people so again just the most important

thing for a brand is keeping it real

just just be the most real you know with

yourself and very well said Thank you

and Kenya how about you

um I would say uh definitely keeping it

real

um just knowing who you are as a brand

and that brand identity but before you

become a brand because I have learned to

think from a business point of view

um secure your brand

um you know not just on GoDaddy and

getting the website but go to the USPTO

if you got to get an attorney lock your

stuff down if you can and look at it

from that I got a cease and desist which

is a kind of a blessing for me

um early on because I had a whole nother

name I thought I was rocking it and then

they were like oh no ma'am that's hours

and I didn't do my homework I was I

didn't know any better and so but Sylvia

Molly was the best name that I could

have ever gotten that represents my

family but

um just doing that and just

do it it don't have to be perfect you

don't have to have a perfect website you

don't have to have a perfect collection

you can drop one skirt

you can draw one they don't know that it

ain't produced it could be one skirt and

then you got 10 orders and then you'd be

like okay girl you're gonna help me make

these 10 skirts like whatever you have

to do just do it don't wait for the

perfect situation to actually launch

that brand because people launching

Brands every day and a lot of the brands

that you think got their stuff together

don't have their stuff together you know

you got major brands that are making

millions and dollars and they still do

pre-sale when they can just go ahead and

just push that stuff out if they wanted

to but just do it I think my biggest

thing is do it there is no perfect way

to do it I'm I mean we're all learning

as we go every single day

um but just do it I think a lady I made

a dress for this lady one time and um

she came to pick it up but the dress was

too tight because she told me that she

was a 10 but she was a 16. it was a mess

right you know what I'm talking about

so she said well I'll come and I'll come

back and get it when I can fit it so

then two days later I get like a thing

from PayPal and PayPal was like your

customer said they never received a

dress and I was like

she lying but you know on PayPal there

is no section to say she lying

it was either did you ship it or not but

I'm like but she came in there to get it

and then she messaged me and she said I

hope that you learned a valuable lesson

from that and then the emotional part of

me was going to be like

but then I had but then I messaged back

and I said you know what I did and that

was the day when I got like nda's work

for hires agreements contracts or this

whatever everything is a Learning lesson

but just don't stop don't give up it

don't have to be perfect just go out

there and be the best designer that you

want to be I am so whatever you want to

call me and you need me to be like what

is you doing just do it again there's

just no perfect way to do it just do it

make the dress make the skirt it could

be ugly somebody gonna buy it it's a

customer for everything

I love it I love it also great advice I

I just feel that throughout the theme of

yeah just do it no matter what it is get

it done I love it so much

um I know we're nearing the end of our

panel but I I want to hear from each of

you do you have any exciting projects

coming up whether it's I don't know

maybe she an ex related or otherwise

Valerie I'll start with you

um that was fun too y'all but um what I

have coming up next is my next Sheen

drop which is going to be for the girls

that look like me

[Music]

um they've been cussing me out they're

like um honey it only stops at a large

I'm like I'm sorry so I gotta do

something for the girls that look like

me and like I said um we are rebranding

as a brand so Sylvia Molly is getting

rid of all of our small sizes I'm sorry

guys but the 10 to 20 will be my new

space and I think that it is something

that I am beyond excited about I wake up

in the morning be like oh the girls is

going to be so fly I really wake up like

that and I really feel like

I mean I know that's supposed to be a

fashion designer but I really for the

first time really feel like

that size in that space is mine I really

feel like I'm really truly have found my

path and I think that all the girls that

represent in that 10 to 20 space

um

is going to be exciting and so hopefully

you know that product and development

phase is long getting them patterns

right and trying to adjust to a curvier

body is different I mean I can talk to

you all day on why brands do not create

plus size

um

because it's different you got to count

you got them hams and thighs we have

some Sequim pans and we were like wait

we got to put a gusset in them joints

because her she's gonna start a fire

down there on his side

there's a lot of things you have to

consider but it's not for real

but it's necessary and I'm excited about

it so

um please support the brand if you got

any women that you know a Net 10 to 20

space we will be launching hopefully in

May hopefully
