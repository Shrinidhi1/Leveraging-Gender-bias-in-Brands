- [Narrator] Indian
weddings are nothing short

of a giant celebration,

But the problem a lot of
men face when it comes

to weddings is how to get
ready for different functions.

First and most important
is grooming yourself well.

If we have to break it down further

it's about your hairstyle and facial hair.

The latest hairstyle
trend is the undercut,

built on short sites and a long top

which creates a cool and
classy look for all hair types.

When it comes to facial
hair for a wedding look,

a clean shaven look is a
classic for any occasion.

If you want to keep a beard,

make sure it's a light stubble
just holding your face.

You can use Gillette skinguard
to get a comfortable shave.

It works to minimize tug and pull

and cuts hair while
barely touching the skin.

Traditionally, Indian weddings
have four to five functions

and here we take you
through what you can wear

for each function to stand
out and make an impression.

Starting out with the Mehendi ceremony.

For men, Mehendi ceremony
is a fairly simple function

which doesn't require too much effort

when it comes to an outfit.

A smart and well-fitted
Kurta pajama does the trick.

When it comes to Kurta
remember, simple is elegant.

The next function which
is usually followed

by the Mehendi, is the Haldi.

Usually this function happens in the day,

so you can wear light
color Churidar and Kurta's.

Shades of yellows, oranges,
off whites are apt.

You can add a Nehru jacket to your look

and make it a little more
elegant and different,

but go easy on the embroidery and prints.

One of the most fun-filled

and most loved functions of any

Indian wedding is the Sangeet.

Here you can experiment
with different outfits.

You can try a waist coat with formal pants

for a sharp Dapper
look, or a casual blazer

with jeans and a t-shirt
for a chilled out look.

If you want to stick to their
traditional Indian attire

and Indo western outfit or a Pathani

does go well to suit the occasion.

The main wedding ceremony
is an auspicious affair,

so it is important you dress well for it.

Ideally, a Sherwani is
apt for the occasion,

but you can also opt for a
Nehru jacket or a Bandhgala.

Preferably choose pastel
shades that look elegant.

The last function is a reception.

For men, a reception outfit
usually comprises of a suit.

Every man should ideally own

a well-made suit in his wardrobe

for occasions like these.

You can even experiment
by wearing a good blazer

or a waist coat that make you look classy,

yet not too formal.

So this was our idea of
dressing perfect for a wedding.
