i'm a undocumented resident and i'm a

latina business owner

[Music]

at 12 i picked up my mom's eyebrow

pencil and it gave me a lot of

confidence

and when i was in high school it's when

i found my passion for makeup

the first time i walked into sephora i

was 14 and

as soon as i walked in i fell in love

with the store any product that you're

looking for

they're gonna have it when i was in

beauty school i started learning more

techniques

and i had more clients and i knew that

that was for me

i knew that that's what i wanted and i

started my own business

i love my clients i'm able to provide

them with a full service

and i also give them makeup classes

[Music]

i was born in michoacan mexico i was

eight when i moved to the united states

my mom and my dad decided to move from

mexico to the u.s

because in mexico there's a lot of

poverty they knew that they were not

going to be able to give us

the same future we have now when we got

here we moved to

my aunt's house and then from there we

got our own little studio with my family

so my mom my dad me and my two sisters

it was hard for my family because i saw

my parents struggle a lot

[Music]

my mom would wake up at four in the

morning and they had to be

in the fields by 6 am it was very hard

for them because they had to be in the

sun

all day working a 12-hour shift and

my dad would get home at six and have to

go to his second job at 8 pm

and then from that he would get home

like at 3 a.m and

he would sleep a couple hours and he

would wake up and do the same routine

all over again it was very hard because

we weren't able to see him

they were times where

they could barely pay for a rent so

that was the only thing they were able

to afford at that time

people sometimes have a stereotype of

undocumented people that we

are lazy that we don't work that we come

here to take

their jobs away that we don't contribute

to the society

the truth is that we are very

hardworking people

a lot of field workers are the reason

that many people

have food on their table i'm in the

process of becoming a us citizen

and i know that this will open a lot of

doors for me my parents sacrificed so

much for me

i have to give something back to them so

that's my motivation for me to keep

going

it's very important for me to tell

people my story

because i know there's a lot of

undocumented people out there

if you want something in life you have

to work very hard for it

but you will get through it and

everything's possible you just have to

keep

faith and be strong

you
