oh wait one thing

[Music]

everybody does that okay

i have

[Music]

that'll be good for the boomerang

[Music]

okay so what i love about

this primer is that sometimes i can just

get away with wearing it and it gives me

this like dewy fresh look

when you use it with the foundation i

love how it kind of gives you that

little dewy effect and it kind of

shimmers underneath the makeup and you

can kind of tell a little bit

brighter done while i do and prep my

makeup

i want to use honor

to moisturize my lips let that sit in

now we are moving on to positive light

tinted moisturizer

for the tinted moisturizer i would

suggest using your hands if they are

clean and prepped and ready to go for

your face if not the foundation brush

works well as well

i don't really like to use

any sort of

i guess method behind tinted moisturizer

because essentially you want the tinted

moisturizer to feel

like your normal moisturizer

and it has obviously a little bit of

coverage but not too much

and it also has spf 20.

it goes on really easy and it feels just

like a light moisturizer it doesn't feel

thick it doesn't feel heavy oh it's so

pretty i'm so happy the liquid touch

brightening concealer

what i love about this is our slant so i

can kind of go in a little bit

in the corners and then use the

thicker side of it to kind of go into

the eye i love concealer so not gonna

lie

i sometimes go a little overboard

if i feel like it

shooting season one of only murders in

the building was really nerve-racking i

didn't quite know

what was gonna happen i just knew that

we were gonna create something

that people would hopefully enjoy and to

see the reaction that the show has

gotten has been

beyond humbling and and such a beautiful

experience and

i get to share it with two really

hilarious old guys that also use rare

beauty might i add on the show proudly

of course season two has been so much

fun the characters have evolved and

just seeing where the story takes you is

not what you expect

stay vulnerable melting blush

and nearly rose

goes a long way

only because we've created products that

are really pigmented the moments that

i've had with rare beauty come from the

tiniest things to the you know greater

scale which

means a comment that somebody will show

me from the team will make my whole day

just

hearing what people are saying about

the brand is really exciting but more

importantly with the messages and

that makes me really proud

of me and my team just because

that's what our goal was when creating a

line and then another moment was

probably when

the liquid eyeliner

went number one and i break down we

created such a beautiful precision with

the brush and having it be formed from

the calligraphy brush is just it was

really

exciting the perfect strokes universal

volumizing mascara

one of my proudest

creations

so the reason i'm

beyond proud of my mascara is because i

used to wear lash extensions i was

losing a lot of my eyelashes and

when i started to create the line and i

knew we were gonna come up with

a mascara i was like okay well i'm going

to stop getting lash extensions and i'm

going to really try to find the right

mascara that will

help my lashes look full feel full

but i was also fearful of creating that

because it's a very it's like a lot of

pressure once we create the final

product it was

so exciting to not only just have my own

lashes feel like

they're

on their own little

world

i just love the reaction that other

people had as well from you know

straight down lashes curly lashes far

slashes

i felt like we were able to create a

truly universal product with the mascara

it also just like

really really

bumps up your eyes i couldn't be

like happier so very proud of that

next would be my stay vulnerable glossy

lip in

nearly rose

the challenging part was kind of setting

the tone for what rare was gonna be and

really genuinely create products that i

know

work and that i know i feel good in it's

all i ever use and it's only because i

just want to continue to make great

products that make people feel good and

that are affordable so that's

that's my little like

finish it with the always an optimus 4

in my mist

about eight inches away do about two

okay
