- [Narrator] Being stylish is
a skill that not all men have.

Some men are blessed with
it, while some are not.

However, being stylish is not hard,

but you can always learn and improve.

In this video,

we'll take you through
men's style transformation.

Starting from the top,

first, let's talk about hair.

Invest in good hair products
like shampoo, conditioner,

which help your hair look good

and style them to create
a rocking impression.

A shabby and unkempt beard

will give you a messy appearance,

even if you wear the best of clothes,

so it is important you shave your beard,

Having a clean-shaven look

makes you look younger and fresher.

The Gillette MACH3 with stronger blades,

glides on your skin,

giving you a smooth, comfortable shape.

Now let's talk about clothes.

Baggy and loose is out of fashion.

Make sure your clothes fit you well,

not too tight, or too loose.

Denims are a must have,

but play around with your look

by trying out some cool chinos.

Chinos are stylish casuals

that give you a smarter look than denims.

Moving on to your shoes.

Invest in a pair of loafers or sneakers,

they match with every outfit you wear,

and make you look cool and stylish.

And this is how you can transform

into a stylish, good looking man.
