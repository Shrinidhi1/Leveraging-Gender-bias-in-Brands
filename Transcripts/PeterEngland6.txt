hi everyone I'm here with the review of

new work and travel bags from Peter

England called the PE bags this is the

office backpack the first thing that

strikes me about this bag is its stylish

design I really like the styling on the

bag the arches in front are nicely

contrasted with the side straps lots of

attention to detail nice gun metal

fittings and it also has a cool looking

logo this bag is clearly made for

everyday use it's perfect when you write

to work and it's very comfortable to

carry even when stand in a bus or a

train necessary water bottle pouch now

let's take a look inside shall we love

the contrast over here bright and happy

orange every time very roomy inside with

space for all that you need whenever I

need my teeth

these cushion compartments help protect

everything I once dropped my bag not a

thing bro Peter England backpack a great

office buddy

you
