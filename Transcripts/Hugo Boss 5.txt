before that moment when you know you've

got it comes the preparation look at

every nuance every angle

every corner

[Music]

first you analyze it all then you

prepare for what's to come and when

you've left no stone unturned you can

embrace your journey focus on the

present not the past see off the

unexpected move how you want to move and

believe in yourself and when you can do

that then you can control the

uncontrollable even as a kid the more I

listened the more I adjusted the more my

path became clear focus and you can

achieve greatness

that's my path that's my journey

[Music]
