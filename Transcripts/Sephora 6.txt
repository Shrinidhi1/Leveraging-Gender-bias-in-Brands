i was born with a bilateral cleft

lip and palette my upper lip

and my palate were not formed when i was

born

kids would call me names and they would

just

sometimes like come over to me and just

tell me you're so

ugly

[Music]

naomi glasses i am native american

my navajo plan is yucca fruit strung out

on a lion clan

i grew up in mesa arizona which wasn't

predominantly native american

and at times i felt different

as being not just the only native kid

but also having a bilateral cleft lip

as i got older and became

more apparent that i was being bullied

kids would call me names like rhinoceros

nose and

oh my and i realized i was gonna

[Music]

when i didn't feel like i belonged my

family was always there to

tell me that i was loved that i was

beautiful

skateboarding helped me definitely

escape from what others said

and i could just ride for hours

with skateboarding there are no bounds

to what you can or can't do

i had to go through numerous surgeries

to fix my

lip but now if you look at me today you

can't tell

the first time i went into sephora it

definitely helped me

feel confident because

my scars are on my face makeup can put

the focus

on my eyes it's about having fun

seeing how big i can make my eyeliner

wing

and it makes me feel all the more

powerful

regardless of what anyone says

i know that i'm beautiful

as a modern-day navajo person we always

referred to

coming back to the reservation as coming

home

we decided to move back and

i remember being so thrilled to just

live freely where i live on the

reservation

there is no running water no internet

connection and some people don't have

electricity

my typical day starts with feeding the

animals

my grandma has always told me that if i

take care of them they'll take care of

me

the sheep they provide me my wool for my

weaving

from that i make rugs and i also

make purses i really

have a deep admiration for rug weaving

because something that's been in my

family for seven generations

my favorite navajo thing is

it means life is what you make it

regardless of any struggles that we face

as navajo people we are all empowered

we are creative and we are strong
