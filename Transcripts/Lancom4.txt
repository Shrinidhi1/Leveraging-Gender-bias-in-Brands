[Music]

dear mom our memories together bring me

joy when i first started my career

before every flight you would hug me at

the elevator and we would cry in each

other's arms

as i left you would always give me the

same pep talk you told me to stay strong

no matter what

years later i realized that my

confidence came from your strength for

that i thank you mom for mother's day

i'm gifting you a scent that makes me

happy too

la viet belle is the iconic lancome

fragrance both you and i love it's sweet

and floral with notes of iris and sugar

that make me smile just like you do i

love you happy mother's day
