one of the biggest struggles

growing up as a documented resident was

definitely finding my own identity

without letting my status

affect who i am as a person

my name is daniela and i work at sephora

i am the senior artist so i get to

inspire and elevate others craft

i got to the us when i was nine years

old my mom

wanted to come here to give us a better

life

i remember her always working very hard

to give us everything that we needed and

what we wanted

obviously as a single mom coming in here

and starting brand new it's very hard

and something that i know that it was

not easy for her

so when we first moved here we went to

school

pretty much everything normal i think

that i started seeing the effects of

uh being undocumented resident when i

got to my teenage years

but i knew that it was something that i

couldn't really talk about

because people can be cruel sometimes

people will use things against you just

to be mean

so i knew that it was something that we

could only talk between

myself my mom and my sister

[Music]

in 2019 my mom

was denied her residency

after living here for 20 years and they

told her that there was nothing else she

could do that she had to go back

[Music]

and that was a time that was very hard

i'm getting emotional um

it was a time that was very hard for me

and my sister because like i said me and

my mom

and my sister were everywhere together

um

she was my best friend

[Music]

after she left my store director told me

that i could take as much time as i

needed for myself

and then when i went back to work i can

say that my sephora family played a huge

part

my store director was amazing she was

very very supportive and very caring

about the whole situation

and i think that being at work and

seeing how much support i was getting

not only from my family

but from my sephora family it made me

feel at ease and it made me feel like i

wasn't alone

and and because that's how i was feeling

i was feeling like i had lost part of

myself when she left

i try to talk to my mom every single day

i try to make it feel like she never

left

transitioning to a completely different

culture all over again it's been hard

for her

hopefully we'll get to see her soon we

miss her a lot and

i really want her to come back and i

know that one day

we'll be a family together again

you
