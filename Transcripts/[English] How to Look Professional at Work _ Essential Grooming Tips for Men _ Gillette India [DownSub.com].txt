- [Narrator] Most of us work

in the nine to five
corporate culture today

and how you dress up
plays an important role.

Your work wear, or business
look is a reflection

of yourself and helps form an impression.

In this video, we'll give you tips

on how you can look professional

at work and make an impression.

The first and the most
important tip is grooming.

When it comes to work,

you have to ensure your hair

and beard are perfect
and not unkempt or shabby

as that can be a deal breaker.

In most corporates,
beard is not appreciated.

It looks a little unprofessional.

Having a clean shaven look

is always a safer option and goes well

with your professional look.

Avoid sporting long hair.

Instead go for short and styled hair.

The side locks should be well shaped

and close to the skin for
a neat corporate look.

Moving on to tip number two, shirts.

If you see, most corporate professionals

wear light colored solid
shirts in pastel shades.

Wear a well fitted shirt.

Loose shirts get messy and wrinkled

when you try to tuck in.

When it comes to formal trousers,

you should prefer wearing
dark colored pants.

A black gray, or a navy blue is perfect

for office wear.

Avoid wearing ankle length trousers

as it is usually looked down upon

in the corporate culture.

One wardrobe essential
for every man is a pair

of formal shoes.

And that's tip number four, shoes.

For everyday office or work wear,

you should wear black
or brown formal shoes.

Tip number five, wristwatches.

Choose a wristwatch that
goes with your outfit.

You can even experiment
wearing a smartwatch

since it's in the trend now.

Now these were some quick
tips to look your best

and make an impression.
