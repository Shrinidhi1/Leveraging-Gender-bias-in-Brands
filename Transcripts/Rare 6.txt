hey everyone welcome to our first ever

rare impact virtual mental health event

i am so excited for you to hear from all

of our expert speakers and partners here

today

mental health is personal for me and

i've always hoped that by sharing my own

story using my platform and working with

an incredible community like all of you

we can help others feel less alone and

access the mental health care they need

education around mental health is

something that i deeply care about and

believe in

wishing i had it while i was growing up

as well

that is why today i'm so excited to kick

off your words matter our rare impact

educational campaign to guide you on how

to share and how to respond when talking

about mental health

because the stories that we share the

words that we use and how we each

respond

matters

when i launched rare beauty i wanted it

to be so much more than a beauty brand

i wanted it to be a platform for

creating community connection and mental

health resources for young people

and that's what rare impact is

i also wanted to make sure there was a

long-term commitment to making sure

everyone had access to the mental health

support that they need and we aim to do

that through the rare impact fund

i am incredibly grateful that you are

words matter campaign we wanted to bring

some of these incredible experts to all

of you

your words matter is rare impact's

educational campaign to guide you on how

to talk about share and respond when

talking about mental health you'll learn

more about this today and as you follow

along our social channels throughout the

month

joining me to share more of this

campaign i am so excited to introduce

you to our rare beauty mental health

council member and campaign partner

tremaine elemine

tremaine runs on chai tea she's a

well-being and health equity strategist

and proudly serves as a member of the

rare beauty mental health council

as the client experience officer for

mental health first aid usa a public

mental health training program of the

national council for mental well-being

she has contributed to more than 2.5

million individuals being equipped to

recognize signs and symptoms related to

mental health substance use and suicide

across the country including training

our very own rare beauty team

tremaine thank you so much to you and

the team at mental health first aid for

being a partner in this campaign we are

so grateful to launch your words matter

with you and shed light on how the words

we use

especially when talking about mental

health have more power than we may

realize

whether we're speaking or responding

it's so important to be mindful of word

choice

and i know day in and day out you teach

so many people about this through your

work and your trainings can you start by

sharing with everyone a little bit about

the purpose behind this campaign why is

word choice so important when it comes

to mental health

well listen elise first of all thank you

you are more than welcome we're so

honored just to be a part of this um

first of all i saw people joining from

all over the world um and so excited

about the work that rare beauty and rare

impact are doing um and what i would say

about this campaign it is it's more like

an invitation really it's uh we're

inviting people to slow down we're

inviting people to be intentional um to

understand that what we say has power

just like what we do

and especially when it comes to mental

health your the campaign the your words

matter campaign um is really about

i think at least ensuring that we choose

our words carefully as we talk about

mental well-being but it's also about

sharing that our small changes the

little things that we do small

adjustments in our conversations can

create so much room for someone to say

what's really happening for them or for

us to catch up to ourselves uh and be

more willing to acknowledge our own

state of mental well-being and then talk

about these topics that for so long for

too long have been so taboo in our

communities

i love that thank you and we talked and

a lot of the resources that we created

together um

they talk about a couple things it talks

about

person-first language it also talks

about

you know what are what are some common

ways in which the context for certain

words

really matters i think there's there's

sort of two different things we've been

talking about a lot in the development

of this campaign how no one's defined by

their illness and a simple change in

language

can help us destigmatize mental health

around that piece and then this second

piece around

how we've started to normalize throwing

around words that are actually clinical

terminology and they really contribute

to increasing stigma can you talk a

little bit in more detail about

person first language and also

how we've normalized as a society and

how we really need to think a little bit

more intentionally about the way we

throw around words that are actually

clinical words that can hurt someone

yeah i think one of the things that i

love about what we've been able to

discuss and to create is this

opportunity to think about what are we

saying day to day right if we think

about um i always use the example you

know sometimes we might say things like

oh this weather is so bipolar

um or use another clinical term in ways

that don't really support a community

or individuals in our community and

being their full selves and being able

and comfortable to talk about the

challenges they really are facing so

when we exaggerate by using these

clinical terms we may be well-meaning

and have you know this opportunity to

have more color colorful language but if

we aren't using those terms in ways that

support um rather than harm then we can

do damage and unknowingly and so i think

um that's part of what we train in

mental health mental health first aid um

is to make sure that people know which

words to use and then when to use them i

think both of those are critically

important i love that so we and we talk

a little bit about um and i know you do

in mental health first aid how to

recognize or listen to someone's story

and respond and

you know if we're hearing someone misuse

a word what what is the way to kindly

sort of

respond and help i think everybody here

today wants to be part of

okay we can be mindful and really work

on our own conversations and our own

words but how do we also influence

others when we're hearing stories or

we're hearing things be thrown around

and we actually want to contribute to

educating even more people what is the

what's really the right way to respond

and to and to help influence so many

people here have

large platforms or even if we're talking

to a friend or family member um you know

the impact is just the same

yeah yeah i think um i love that you

said you know impact because that's what

it really is about um and as i think

about it it's about where that

foundation is and so at national council

for mental well-being we really uh look

at mental well-being as thriving

regardless of a mental health or

substance use challenge and so helping

folks uh to choose their words is what

we do uh as you mentioned through mental

health first aid but i think also one of

the

opportunities we have is to do so with

kindness that's another word that stuck

out to me that you said um

we don't have to

have to

um

call people out

um in in a way that is not helpful and

so one of the things that you know we're

all influencers in some way in our own

spaces and circles right um and so just

our adjustments on a day-to-day basis if

you think about it um asking someone you

know how can i support you um creating

the conversation and the space for those

conversations to happen um i've been

guilty of it you know i talk fast at

least you know that oh when i get guilty

of it

and so i've been guilty of getting

really excited if i'm talking about

well-being or community impact or equity

and inclusion like those are my subjects

oh and carbs carbs is not we know you

love carbs we know you love this

conversation

so and so i've been guilty of

my my head going slower than my mouth

and you know wanting to take those words

back and sometimes the damage has been

done so it's really really important um

that we look at this as a journey and

not a destination just like the recovery

journey we're on a road together of

learning and so it's really important

that we keep that in mind

i love that you said we're on this

journey and kind of all about being

mindful and thinking i know that later

in this conversation when jay shetty

joins us

um

i know he has some of these guidelines

for what you think about before you

speak

um

that i think will be really really

valuable to this conversation um so i

love that you said that um well i i want

to thank you so so much for helping us

kick this off

i am going to turn it over to you for

our next session which i'm so excited

for

um and i will see you all in a little

bit

thank you so so much elise um i'm

excited it's always a pleasure to talk

to you and i was so energized by our

discussion so thank you

so

really looking forward to our next

conversation y'all uh so excited that

you're all here and joining us and i'm

excited to bring up three incredible

speakers for our ask and expert panel

we get to hear directly from mental

health experts uh the first two of which

are mental uh our rare beauty mental

health council members and we'll learn

ways to share about our own mental

health stories as well as destigmatize

conversations around mental health

today we are joined by dr jessica gold

psychiatrist professor and director in

the department of psychology at

washington university school of medicine

we're also with us is dr mark brackett

founder and director of the yale center

for emotional intelligence

and author of permission to feel

and we're thrilled to be joined by sahaj

kohli speaker writer and founder of

brown girl therapy

please welcome our esteemed panelists we

can't wait to get started i'll go ahead

and give them some claps and everything

in the chat

uh welcome welcome welcome to you all

hello

thanks for being here

thank you

so today as elise and i were discussing

we're learning how much our words matter

right especially when it comes to our

mental health each of you works with a

variety of people across age identity

culture

and backgrounds

so why are words so important to mental

health this first question by the way is

open to everyone so it'll be great if

you share a little bit more about

yourself with the community that's

gathered with us today as well

who wants to start

i'm trying to be a gentleman here i was

letting sahaja yoga but i'm failing

i am really excited to be here so my

name is sahajkoli i am the founder of

brown girl therapy which is the first

and largest mental health community for

children of immigrants living in the

west um i am about to finish my master's

degree so i have been working as a

therapist in training i'm also a former

journalist i worked in journalism for

about seven years so my passion lies at

the intersection of narrative

storytelling and mental health and so as

a former journalist as a now therapist

i practice as a narrative therapist and

i really do value the words that we use

and the words that my clients use to

talk about themselves i think for for my

population i work with children of

immigrants and immigrants often the

people i work with are straddling two

very different cultures to very

different norms to very different value

systems and so it can be really

difficult to feel like you're getting

all of these externalized messages and

those develop into these internalized

messages and stories that we tell about

ourselves often what i see is these

stories are peppered with shame with

self-blame and so it's really important

for us to interject kindness and

compassion in the way that we talk about

ourselves the ways that we talk about

mental health and the ways that we talk

about other people

as small as it seems like you were

saying in the introduction it really can

make such a significant impact on our

mental health and the ways that we feel

a sense of belonging in our

relationships and in the systems we live

in

dr jessica gold go ahead okay hey um so

i'm i'm jesse gold i'm a psychiatrist

for those who don't know because i think

it's kind of confusing that means i went

to medical school and can prescribe

psychiatric medicine

i also primarily in my clinic see

college students and health care workers

and also am a writer too i did it the

opposite way though where i went to the

medical path first and then started

writing

i think words are really important

because it's hard to get people to want

to ask for help anyway and so if the

words make them feel for some reason

that there's something wrong with them

for asking for help or they have a

weakness for asking for help or whatever

label that puts on them in their

communities if they already have that

why would they want to ask for help so i

think the words we use can make it

easier for people to feel comfortable

actually just saying like something's

wrong like i need to talk to someone and

i think that's really important

absolutely absolutely and rounding us

out yeah thank you

so um

for me you know it's funny when i was

listening to your introduction i all i

did was regress back to my childhood

um because um

none of you know me but my my day job is

i'm a professor of psychology at yale um

and my other job is i run around the

world trying to get people to talk about

their feelings

and what i find

is that most people just don't have the

language they don't have the words to

communicate clearly i'm fine i'm okay

i'm busy

but really how are you feeling and just

briefly you know i was um i grew up in

new jersey and i had a pretty tough

childhood um

meaning that uh i was abused as a kid

and uh

i had two parents who loved me but they

didn't really know

anything about emotional intelligence

uh however i was blessed believe it or

not by an uncle who was building a

program to teach children

emotional illiteracy

and when i was 11 years old i had an

uncle who was sitting with me in the

backyard

and he looked at me and he just said

mark

how are you feeling

but really how are you feeling

and it was that moment

that everything was able to come out and

he wasn't judging me for what i was

sharing he didn't say you know

i can't handle it or toughen up

it was all about listening

being compassionate

and honestly it started my whole career

as a psychologist and what i've learned

is that

most people just don't have the words

and so my career has been uh supporting

people and building their emotional

vocabulary and then learning the

strategies to help them manage the full

range of emotions

okay mark so

just saying um that's powerful and so so

incredibly helpful in helping us

understand

you know

why you're in this field unknowing your

why right and i think that's incredibly

powerful and important i think all of us

have that we have this reason we do what

we do and what we're motivated by um

could you continue to talk to us about

that um

a little bit your work at the yale

center for emotional intelligence um in

your book permission to feel really do

give people that deeper insight into the

world of social and emotional

understanding and so um that embracing

of feelings uh you're the emotion

scientist i saw so

as the emotion scientists on our panel

today could you share a few things that

we should consider as we approach these

conversations um

about mental health either in school or

at work or in our communities you know

with co-workers colleagues uh those the

relationships are different so can you

give us some perspective and a few

things that we should consider we have a

whole day for this right right i mean

it's only two minutes but

like figuring this out but um you know

the first thing is i just want to say up

front

that

none of us is born with this knowledge

or this skill

you know there's no air of our brain

that has like emotion language and

evidence-based strategies to help us

regulate our feelings

i didn't know that was until i was in

graduate school to be honest with you

and so we need to just make these

concepts available as early as possible

that means the parents or giving birth

to children and raising children the

teachers who are you know raising kids

in a different way communities

and with that said

um i think the first step

is giving ourselves the permission to

feel

and so you know going back to my own

story the abuser in my situation

threatened me i was silenced

and so imagine what it's like for a

five-year-old or a six-year-old or a 15

or 20 or 40 year old

to be un you know restricted

in articulating their experience

it's awful because it leads to

suppression repression

depression the list goes on

and

so for me that's the first step and then

the question is well who are these

people

and what i found in my research is that

there's three core characteristics plus

many others

they show empathy

they have compassion

and they are non-judgmental

and so those are kind of the core

characteristics of these people in our

lives and then you know it moves on to

being curious as opposed to critical

about emotions getting that language

right

so ruler is the framework that i use

which is recognizing emotions

understanding their causes and

consequences

labeling them with precise words

being comfortable expressing those

feelings which takes discernment by the

way because when i when i ask you how

are you feeling you have to trust me

yeah you're gonna you're gonna i'm gonna

listen and be there for you and then

finally you know the strategies that

help us to regulate our feelings and

we're finding that this is where people

really fall short people just haven't

learned and practiced

really

helpful strategies i'll stop there

yeah yeah i mean i think all of those

are so critical all of those strategies

and knowing what to do

it just ties in so much to what we

talked about earlier and the skills and

things that we can learn by doing

trainings etc uh and we do that and you

mentioned uh mark that that was

in um

you were you were experiencing that or

getting aware of those words in graduate

school

and jesse you work with college students

um and so uh i think it would be great

to hear from you i know you work with

college students and health care

professionals that support youth and

young adults and so that perspective

there's often a you know significant

stress that is happening during that

time um but how can we recognize and

really support someone who might be

experiencing a mental health crisis

situation right and not just naming

those feelings but they might be in a

crisis or if maybe it's me and i know

i'm struggling but i don't know where to

turn where to go first um

how do we use our words to really deal

with crisis situations

absolutely so thanks for asking the

question and also thank you mark for

sharing i think it's really hard to

share something like that in front of

people especially honestly as a

professional in the field so thank you

for doing that um you know i think when

i think about how you know you're in

crisis versus not i think it's hard to

exactly give you a definition or say

like this is how you know at this moment

that you need help but i think a lot of

what it has to do is change over time

and how long it's been so if you've been

struggling with your mood like you know

identifying your feelings like mark said

and you repeatedly feel sad and it's

been a while meaning not a week but

weeks or it's changed and it's gotten

worse so you're feeling sadder as an

example i think that is a good way to

kind of know that something's more

severe or that you're more in need of

seeing someone like

anyone on this panel for you know mental

health help or you know me which would

be kind of a bit further along depending

on need for medicine but i think you

know when you're talking to someone

about their struggles and what they're

going through i think the most important

thing is just to be there for them so i

think people really want to give advice

and really want to say

well when this happened to me i did this

so that can be helpful but sometimes

people just want you to listen and

sometimes people have never said

anything to anyone before like this is

the first time they've ever told someone

they're struggling but they are really

struggling right and so being there for

somebody and just listening is a big

thing and you can often say something

like would it be helpful if i gave you

advice afterwards and actually using our

words to make sure that we're not giving

someone something that they don't want

or that would feel invalidating in a way

to them so would it be helpful if i

helped you one of the ways i think it's

most helpful for people when you're the

friend or the family member is it's

really hard to make phone calls and ask

for help right like we basically say

you're feeling you're struggling call

all these people when you're sad and

have no energy or you're anxious and

don't want to pick up the phone and talk

to people right so if your friend is

struggling one of the things that is a

good thing to offer if you can would be

would be helpful for me to call some of

those people with you or call some of

those people for you so it's not such a

big burden and so i'm here for you and

you know that you asked for help and you

can actually find it yeah yeah asking

for help and actually find it right

that's such a key component of that

jesse um sahaj you are helping people

find that help

and then your training to help people

help get help uh which uh thank you and

shout out to all those that are doing

the work in communities but also hopeful

that you're taking care of yourselves

because it's such a need right now um

professional help is available and

needed but it's not always available or

needed right and so we need some of the

helpers to be in this other space and

we need that help to be culturally

relevant um and so uh sahaj in your work

with brown girl therapy um you really

highlight and address the unique

experience as you mentioned of children

uh of individuals who've immigrated from

another country what can you really

uh if you had to in a sound bite um

because you could we can do a whole

presentation y'all just the four of us

for three days i i kid you not it could

happen um so

if you could tell us what are the things

that we can do at the start of a mental

health journey especially for those who

might have the lived experience of being

um a child of an immigrant um especially

for those who maybe don't know what to

say or where to start based on um

what they their cultural experience and

what brings them to where they are

yeah i i definitely do do presentations

on this so i'm going to try to keep this

short because i can talk about this

forever

i will say uh you know i myself as a

child of immigrants i am the first in my

family to be born in the west i am the

first in my family to seek therapy speak

about my mental health openly i am the

first in my family to marry outside of

race religion culture so i understand

what it's like to be the first in your

family navigating these systems and

these different these differing systems

and trying to figure out what it means

to feel a sense of belonging and

acceptance amongst all the people that

you surround yourself with including

your family and your friends and the

people you're socialized with

um when you know over a decade ago i did

experience something traumatic myself

and when i was living at home at the

time i really needed to seek a therapist

and it was the first time my immigrant

parents had ever even heard the words

mental health they had been living in

the country for about 20 years um i had

been born here i had been raised here

but it was the first time that they even

understood what therapy was my dad is a

physician he understands what

psychiatrists do but he didn't

understand that you would just go see a

therapist to talk about your mental

health without it really needing to mean

that something is quote unquote wrong

with you and so i had to first hand

navigate this cross-cultural

communication with them my parents were

taking my struggles my um hurt as

something a reflection of them that they

failed me as their as my as my parents

when in reality they didn't right we can

only protect the people we love as much

as we can we can't protect people beyond

what they will experience out there in

the world and so i had to navigate this

cross-cultural communication where you

know in the western world in in the

world the systems i'm socialized in

we're very explicit and direct and you

know we have paper trails we are very um

communicative in a lot of ways through

our words whereas in the culture i was

born into and raised with at home we're

very implicit we use non-verbal we don't

really ask explicitly we make

assumptions and so i had to navigate

this the situation where i felt like i

almost had to prove what i was going

through and the struggle i was feeling

and i think that was the first step for

me for realizing how important language

is but also how important it is to kind

of even be able to identify what we're

feeling like mark was saying even having

the wherewithal and the language and the

knowledge the emotional knowledge to say

i'm sad i'm hurt i'm struggling that was

not something my parents had the

privilege to ever be able to explore as

immigrants they moved here

you know not with a lot of money or

resources i i definitely have more

research resources than they do and i

see that a lot with children of

immigrants it's something i like to call

as thrivers guilt this idea that we feel

guilty because we have access to so many

more resources and opportunities than

our parents had and so we feel almost

ashamed and guilty for trying to

self-actualize we're trying to reach out

for help

when in reality that is you know it's a

privilege it's also a burden but it's

something that we deserve

and so beyond thriver's guilt i also see

the concept of gratitude shame or toxic

positivity spiritual bypassing this idea

that we should feel ashamed for

struggling because maybe our immigrant

parents or our ancestors who lived

through colonialism and war and poverty

had it worse so therefore there's this

binary thinking that oh since they went

through x y and z i can't struggle i

have so much privilege compared to get

them so i should just just be grateful i

should just suck it up i should just put

my head down when in reality pain and

suffering are not a competition both

things can be true at the same time our

parents can have their own struggles our

friends can have their own struggles and

we can have our own struggles you can

appreciate and respect what your parents

have done for you and you can wish that

they had done more or that they had

resources to understand your struggles

better so finding community and and safe

and psychologically and emotionally safe

relationships is key right so you can do

this through your friends if it's not

your family it might be friends it might

be social media platforms like brown

girl therapy i mean i created this

platform

out of selfish reasons first and

foremost and then it grew into something

much greater for people to be able to

connect with one another and see

themselves um kind of reflected in the

mental health content it's really hard

to feel like you deserve quality care

when the care isn't speaking to your

struggles and so really trying to find

that community is is the number one key

to feeling less alone and being able to

ask for the help that you might need

yeah yeah you said so much um and two of

the things that i think really first of

all folks in the chat are going in and

really excited about all the things um

that all of you have been sharing and um

we're going to give an opportunity so

make sure you're submitting those

questions uh because we will give an

opportunity for us to have that dialogue

um directly with our panelists uh

one of two of the things that all of you

are really have tied into um sahaj from

a creating a platform standpoint um

jessie from the population that you're

focused on and who you're supporting and

mark um your your engagement with young

people as well uh there

are some exchanges that are happening

digitally when it comes to these words

right

if you think about these spaces and

that's one of the things that i love

about rare impact and their beauty and

the creation of this community where it

really is a community it really is uh

coming and being connected and not

feeling oh you know that is real right

so so with everyone on social media with

everything that's happening um

do you have any strategies specific or

let's choose one let's choose one

strategy specifically if you had to

choose one strategy um for coping with

the pressures of social media because we

have those positives of community

building but the pressures of social

media if you had to choose just one

thing uh to share um and navigating that

and you know i think somehow you're

you're navigating that role model kind

of you know peace and title well having

your own struggles right just

jesse as well um you know how do we do

that uh and deal with and what's that

one strategy that's your go-to

i keep saying one

because we don't have a lot of time but

you all are amazing and i want to make

sure people have one and we can get to

some of their questions uh so let's see

uh mark let's start with you

i'll tell you my one strategy which is i

limit how much time i spend on it

because i have addictive qualities to my

personality

and you know i wake up in the morning

the first thing i look at is that how

many people like that post that is not

healthy i know it's not healthy but yet

um

i do it because it just it just you

become programmed

and so even with the news you know

there's so much horrific thing stuff

happening

but you don't need to be reminded of it

every eight minutes

you know you can summarize it at the end

of the day and process it with a partner

with a friend and so to me it's all

about setting limits for myself

excellent excellent that limit setting

those boundaries are really important

um

jesse you want to talk about this one

uh you know quickly for me it's really

like identifying the fact that it

actually affects me and i can have

feelings about it so we're speaking a

lot about you know putting words to

things so i tend to get a lot of

physical symptoms from social media like

grinding my teeth not sleeping well just

feeling really angry and agitated and i

like throughout the pandemic was just

like i must just get angry when i watch

and read things but turns out i don't

have to right so you can do what mark

said and have limits but i think you

start by actually realizing like it has

an effect on you and it can affect your

physical and emotional health

i love that fun fact you don't have to

fun fact um so definitely really helpful

sahaj what's your one thing

my one thing is just remembering

information asymmetry so what that means

is we know everything about our lives

the good and the bad and we only know

the good about other people's lives

because that's usually all they will

share on social media so i have to

constantly remind myself that i don't

know everything that

that's going on in people's lives i am

only getting the filtered beautiful

version of it and that will help me

because you know like jesse is saying

identifying what i'm actually feeling

sometimes i find myself feeling really

inferior why am i not doing that why how

why am i struggling so much why why

haven't have i not you know reached this

milestone yet as these people i'm seeing

but we are all on our journey and just

remembering that i'm getting half of the

story online has helped me remi like put

things into perspective

yeah

half maybe maybe ten percent right

you may be seeing just ten percent of

that person's life mark you were going

to add yes i was gonna add you know

something i've been thinking a lot about

as we've been having this conversation

is you know the title is your awards

matter

and i think that your words matter

also in terms of the words that you use

to describe your feelings in that moment

you know i grew up with a lot of

negative self-talk because i was i had a

lot of bullying in my childhood you know

um i'm gay and i was bullied because i

was too feminine as a kid i was bullied

because of lots of different things my

physical appearance at the time

and um you know and what happens is that

just like cancer that metastasizes

right as you as other people are

defining your reality for you

right you're too feminine you're too fat

you're too dark you're too light you're

too whatever

you start believing it

and it becomes a self-fulfilling

prophecy and so i think that we have to

really become skilled

at pausing and monitoring the words that

are coming to ourselves from ourselves

you know after that happens and and and

recognize that

we need to shift in the direction of

self-compassion as opposed to continuous

self-criticism and i think we need to

spend a lot more time on that at home

with our friends and communities

yeah yes self-compassion oh my speaking

of selfs we have lots of cells that are

joining with us uh from all over and

we've been having this amazing

discussion and i feel like you know we

want to give the community some space to

connect with our speakers and they've

been submitting some amazing questions

um and so i would love love love um if

we can go through some of those so i'm

mark again uh what would you say is a

number one barrier um that people come

across when it comes to regulating that

you talk about self-compassion but is

there one thing that you can say

is a challenge for people to really uh

kind of navigate when it comes to

regulation of those feelings

i'm going to sneak into

um the first is

just haven't learned the strategies

i never learned them i didn't know what

they were i went for therapy for years

and i learned a lot about my

relationship with my mother

but i didn't learn how to deal with my

mother

so

you know i think it's important to get

the skill but the the one that's come up

and you know as a professor i study

college students as well like jess and

the number one strategy that we have

found right now among young people is

not getting enough sleep

that when you are not well rested it's

just hard to even come up with the

strategy so quality sleep

i know i sound like a preacher but it's

so so important

well that's a sermon i'm willing to

listen to i'm just saying um that that

right there is you know our bodies and

minds are one um so

you talk about college students i want

to come over to uh jesse again um

what do you think about setting

boundaries with your peers and your

friends right uh that's a time where

we're discovering and we're figuring it

out and we're sharing uh or over sharing

um or under sharing right um so how do

you uh take into account that emotional

intelligence or

um mental health may not be perceived as

real by some of our friends or family

members uh as a college student

that's a big one you know i think people

often have this conversation with me

where they're like oh everybody talks

about their mental health now

everybody's fine it's so different and

it's not actually true like if that was

true people would get care and my

patients wouldn't have their parents

throw out their medicine right so i

think that we there is a mistake there

in like if it's more in the ethos that

we're comfortable with it we're actually

not right and so with college students

you know i think it's like the first

time a lot of people are away from home

and really their family and their

support system becomes their friends it

might not have ever been that before

maybe you had good friends but it wasn't

the same and you're around them all the

time right which i think is really

important you don't need to be around

people all the time ever and so i think

we get really worried that we're not a

good friend or a good support system if

we have to take a break if we realize

it's affecting us but a hundred percent

is because when someone's struggling if

you care about that person you're gonna

feel it too right so you're allowed to

say this is affecting me you're allowed

to say i need a day off of this and

there are ways to not just say okay i'm

not talking to you anymore but to just

say you know we've really been talking

about this a lot and i just wanted to

let you know it's been affecting me too

and i just need a day

and i think people are very

understanding of that sometimes when

you're sick it's hard to understand what

other people are going through and they

can get a little angry and that might

come up but if you have to put yourself

first and just like we don't learn

feelings when we're kids we don't learn

boundaries when we're kids and both of

those things would have made life a lot

easier for me and every single patient

that i know so understanding that that's

totally okay and no is a complete

sentence is absolutely fine that is my

mantra

i i always talk about shonda rhimes in

her year of yes and my year of no and it

is it is the best thing i've ever done

um so i have a question for you and it's

related to this one so i'm going to i

wanted to jump in on that don't worry no

i'm gonna put you right there on that

train so so

if we think about that from a cultural

context right um you know uh we have a

question that came in around a person

who um has latino latinx heritage and so

um it's

how do you explain

that how i feel is how i feel

um and sometimes it's necessary and it's

nothing to be ashamed about about going

to get that help especially when your

family of origin

may not have those same values and how

do you start that conversation

especially if you've been having maybe

passive thoughts of suicide or

other kinds of things that are can be

alarming for our families but making it

part of that conversation

yeah that's that's definitely a question

i get often um i will say the word

boundaries doesn't exist in a lot of

other cultures right that word is

jarring it feels like a wall when in

reality when someone's asking for

something they need or setting

boundaries they're allowing you to love

them even deeper and more intimately so

that reframe is a really helpful way to

think about why it's important to set

those boundaries in relationships

when talking to immigrant parents or you

know parents of different cultures there

are different things that that i have

found to be really useful for for

children of immigrants when navigating

those conversations first in a lot of

our cultures um uh in our pop culture so

say for me i'm indian bollywood mental

health is starting to become a

conversation that is starting in

bollywood so what i've done is be able

to use pop cultural references that my

parents will understand use media in the

language that they understand it so

instead of using the word depression i

might say stress so trying to figure out

what language you know we co-create

language in the culture in the community

in the families that we exist in so

trying to use shared language that is

understood by all parties is really

essential

i would also say as as touche and

stereotypical as this might sound

sometimes it can be really useful to

bring in medical statistical science

facts to immigrant parents sometimes

they can't even understand feelings that

you know my dad has used woo-woo to

describe it and so when i come in with

the science and the facts and i'm like

here is a harvard business review

article or you know a peer-reviewed

journal on this he is more willing to

listen to what i have to say about

mental health and how it's actually

impacting people

um and then you know the last thing is

to just see if you have any allies

within your family system is it a

sibling is it a cousin is it an uncle um

you know for market with an uncle you

know is there anyone who can be on your

side as you're navigating these

conversations i will say for me i'll be

very honest and say that for me i needed

to get the physical distance from my

parents before i actually got the care

that i needed and by getting that care i

was then in turn able to navigate the

harder conversations with my parents and

so sometimes even though that's not an

answer that is usually liked it

sometimes requires you to do the work on

your own before you're ready to even

start the conversation

that is so critical is knowing where you

are and recognizing where you are on

your own journey um as jesse said

earlier you know we got to know where we

are and what we can help

and and how we can help folks love us

more deeply which i thought was

beautiful um

so

there's another question here around um

you know making sure that

we have an opportunity to to talk a

little bit more about tactical things we

can do we've got about five minutes left

and so i'm trying to choose choose these

carefully um how

how do we

if we think about um word choice

because taking it back to your words

matter right

um how do we

identify uh the words that we choose um

to destigmatize

this conversation and without whatever

circles we're in right uh whether that's

at work or uh in the community

what words in what word choice how can

we choose our words carefully and more

carefully um as we think about the

stigma destigmatizing this conversation

overall and that's open to all of all of

you

i'm happy to jump in really quickly you

know

i lead a group of 60 people um and so

there's a stereotype about

guys being anxious just to put it out

there everybody i've been anxious for 52

years

and

i think that

the more we have courage

to show people and share how we feel but

also show that we're able to deal with

those feelings

just

that alone i think is going to make our

world a better place

that i can be anxious or feel anxious

but it doesn't have to have power over

me i can also be happy and excited and

optimistic

and so um

the more we get comfortable sharing and

also showing that we can regulate i

think

the better we're gonna be

yeah i would just add that i often

notice that in healthcare workers

especially where we're supposed to just

be stoic and have no feelings you know

people get scared that when you have to

share feelings that means you have to

tell your entire history right like

clearly mark has told us history before

so he's comfortable talking about it if

you've never told it before you don't

need to start there right you can say

i'm sad i didn't sleep i'm struggling

and that alone is really vulnerable and

that can connect you to each other open

the conversation to have more

conversation later and it doesn't have

to be all at once

yes i agree with both of those and you

know i think sometimes it's okay not to

have the words i think sometimes it's

about sitting in silence and just saying

hey i don't i feel something feels off

i'm struggling i have used these words

with my own husband to say i don't know

what it is but i i something doesn't

feel right can you just sit with me for

a few minutes um and sometimes just

feeling seen and and and in that way and

having that shared psychological you

know safety and emotional safety can

allow you to then process and explore

what is it that i'm actually feeling

what is it that's actually going on for

me when did the start and start to

really process what's what's happening

for you but you know coming from a

culture where we didn't we don't really

have the language to talk about this in

the way that i've been taught in you

know in graduate school and with western

mental health it's okay if you don't

have the words um and it's okay to tie

you know your emotional and mental

health symptoms to your your body and to

somatic symptoms and like you know i

just i haven't been able to get rid of

the stomach pain i haven't been able to

get rid of this headache often it's

going to be tied to your brain and to

your heart and to different parts of

your body so it's okay if you don't have

the language as long as you know the

most important thing i think here is

just really reflecting and being able to

be more in tune with you and all the

parts of you and not shying away from

that

yeah now you can hear me we have two

minutes um and so much more that i want

to ask you so i'm going to refrain and

hold back for myself from asking

additional questions except for this

last one um i would love for each of you

to just choose one

phrase or word

that's helped you know that your words

matter so think about going to the

recesses dust off the cobwebs and was

there a phrase or one word that helped

you know

that your words

matter

i think for me

something that someone i love very

dearly has started saying to me is that

this does not make you difficult to love

has made it me feel more free to express

myself and choose my words or not even

filter my words when i'm talking about

how i'm feeling because i had always

felt growing up that it would be a

burden to share what it is i'm actually

feeling or thinking and i didn't i

haven't i had internalized that for so

many

years that i you know finding someone

who reminds me without me having to ask

to be reminded because then that's the

cycle of feeling more like a burden and

making that space um allows me to

explore the words

that's amazing that's amazing

jesse mark one phrase or word yeah

i mean such a hard question i i mean i

think for me it's like something like

you matter too you know like i

spend a lot of time taking care of other

people and i don't ever ask myself how

i'm doing and like my therapist is the

person who said like hey wait a second

you matter in this conversation you need

a seat at the table you have feelings

too so i think that that would be what i

would think

awesome and mark closes and closes out

one yeah

some of the research for this which is

that i learned you know that the iii

doesn't necessarily help with regulating

that having empathy and compassion for

yourself so

looking up and saying mark

you can do this mark you can get through

this and just showing that compassion to

yourself is helpful and it really works

for me so i just want to encourage

people to try it

well sahaj jesse and mark your words did

matter today

and i thank you for just sharing space

with us today and everyone that is

joining us thank you so much uh we've

had this amazing discussion um and many

to join you all in this conversation so

let's give them our hand claps and high

fives and emojis in the chat uh and we

appreciate all the rare reminders and

the words uh that we heard that we know

that we have more power than we realize

um and we can help to continue to change

the conversation in our relationships at

home um and in our communities so thank

you very much to the panelists thank you

thank you

hi everyone i'm jessica cruel

editor-in-chief of allure magazine and

thank you so much for joining our

fireside chat i have with me here

two amazing

guests and conversationalists

first i'm joined by dr jessica gold

psychiatrist professor and director in

department of psychology at the washu

school of medicine

and you just saw her speaking earlier

she's a rare beauty mental health

council member so thank you dr jesse for

staying on with us and chatting with us

a little bit more

always thanks for asking

and we're also joined by whitney simmons

conte creator fitness enthusiast and

mental health advocate whitney thank you

so much for joining us thank you for

having me i'm so excited

i see everyone's getting giving you lots

of love in the chat

so we are going to get this uh party

started

all of today we've been learning about

how

our words matter and how those words and

the stories that we're telling and the

conversations that we have can have such

a positive impact on our mental health

and i know whitney you've been using

your platform and your very large

following um to openly share your story

about your mental health journey and to

really be open and vulnerable

with your community and using your words

for good honestly um so thank you for

doing that thank you and dr jesse you

write often about the power of mental

health and

um

using your access to key experts and

being an expert yourself to educate us

and you actually really helped out

creating the rare beauty mental health

media guide which as a journalist i am

have been reading avidly since it came

out over the last couple of days because

i do think language is so important and

how you address people and how they want

to be addressed is so essential to

removing the stigma around mental health

and not making those people feel

other or lesser than and i think that's

so important

so we're going to start off with some

questions whitney

i would love to ask you you know you

recently became sharing began sharing

more openly about your own mental health

journey

on your social following and with your

community yeah so

what made you begin to have those

conversations

and and i know it took so much strength

yeah and to come out and really

say those things and to millions of

people

you know what what made you do that you

know

i give a lot of credit to

my direct support system

and

i had really suffered in science for a

really long time and when you share so

much of your life online this became

such a huge part of my life

and to feel like i was hiding something

that was so important to me and what i

what i've been working through

it didn't feel true to me anymore and so

with the support of

an amazing friend i sat down on her

podcast and she really pushed me to just

sit down and share my story

which was

very nerve-wracking because i didn't

know how people were going to react

and i felt like i was going to kind of

come out of

come out of nowhere and so i was very

nervous about it and after we filmed the

podcast and i listened back to it i

actually asked her not to post it

but she just really pushed me to do and

she was like you know you don't know if

sharing your story can help others and

so

that was the big push that i needed and

since then it's been

very heavily talked about over on my

platform it's very i'm very passionate

about it so it's important i've had such

an amazing

response from the amazing women in my

community

and now we are just it's a heavy topic

of discussion over there

well i think it's so interesting that

you said that you were hesitant even

once you've done it you were like oh

wait i can't

i want to back away from that and i find

that that's exactly what social media

does to us right social media is a

highlight reel and you always hear that

but then when you're creating content

you'll say to yourself i was gonna go

there but now i'm watching it back and i

just hate it so much you critique

yourself to every little i should have

said that word i should have said this

word

so i'm so glad that you said that you

were even after you filmed it you were

like no no we're not gonna

we're not gonna post this and then you

had that advocate and that friend there

to encourage you

what do you suggest other people who are

looking you know feeling that pressure

i think

from

social media to be perfect

to not show this side of themselves what

do you recommend that they do

if they're ready to share or thinking

about sharing yeah i think

it's so important to remember that

sharing your personal story creates

connection

and

you your words are so your words matter

your words are so important and your

story can help others and and i was so

hesitant because i didn't know if my

story was

was important i didn't know if anyone

felt the same way that i felt but there

are so many people that feel exactly how

you are feeling

and it is so important to share that

message

when you feel ready

and it brings so much connection and

healing and hope to people that might be

feeling alone right now

dr jesse whitney's talking a little bit

about reactions and when we are on

social media we open ourselves up to

reactions whether they be good or bad

i would love to hear you tell us a

little bit about you know how social

media and how online platforms

how they have

changed the landscape of the mental

health industry over time over a long

over time

it's a big question first i want to say

thanks to whitney for sharing her story

because it's really important to me to

see people with big followings feel

comfortable enough sharing she also said

when you feel ready and i think that

part is really important for people to

hear which is that like you can share

and you could share in the future too so

make sure that you kind of see where

you're feeling with that um you know i

think social media in general has made

us feel more connected to people but

sometimes we don't actually know the

people so it's easy for whitney to say

like my friend who i know told me to put

this up and they pushed me and i knew it

was the right kind of pushing but if

you're in a situation where you know

you're just surrounded by people who you

know from social but they're not people

you've like really connected to there's

a lot of difference in that relationship

and so you feel the pressure to share to

be authentic but nobody you don't owe

anybody your story right like it is

still your story what you choose to

share of your story is too right like i

talk about going to therapy all the time

and i didn't ever talk about being on

medication for years and i'm a person

who prescribes medication right but i

realized that i just hadn't been doing

it and i paid attention to it reflected

on it actually went to therapy on that

myself to try to figure it out and

realize that like i was holding that

back for a reason i ultimately obviously

shared that but i think it's important

that it's not just like you have to

share because you do and you can tell on

social like self-disclosure is great the

way that that's changed the landscape

and mental health is amazing you know

for me to have somebody point to someone

like whitney and say like look what they

did now i feel like i've had the same

symptoms i had the same experience i

feel okay getting help because she did

like that experience has magnified with

social media right before social media

you had publicists who are in charge of

that in deciding who the image like how

to control the image and where to put

that and all of and it's a lot less

accessible and from the person right and

so we're getting a lot more people

saying like actually this is my real

life and this is what i've been

struggling with and i think it's doing

really great things to people getting

help or at least feeling comfortable

starting the conversation

yeah that's so true i think

a lot of times because social media is

just one aspect of a person's life for

the most part uh people don't see what's

behind the scenes for example i'm

editor-in-chief and one thing i always

drop in my conversation is oh me and my

therapist my therapist oh yeah my

therapist said i try to let everyone

know that i go to therapy like everyone

at allure knows that i go to therapy

because i think it's very important that

you know people see

you've reached this high position

you're going on you know fancy trips

you're doing this but in order to do

that i go to therapy every two weeks i

take lexapro every morning

and i have all of these things that help

me achieve and it's not just like i work

hard and keep my head down and i shot to

the top

no it took a lot of help and assistance

to keep my mental health in a good place

and we also don't talk about somehow how

sometimes how these jobs affect our

mental health right i i had to go up

with my prescription because i was like

wait a minute

this is a this is a tough gig i need a

little extra help and so i think those

are things that um we can be much more

open about uh via social media so it

doesn't just seem like

everything's all dandy and perfect and

you know granted you know i'm not gonna

share me crying in the

corner but you could right that's good i

mean i think that you know we were

saying a little you know what has cove

done to that and i think that that's

also made it so people don't feel like

they have to be perfect all the time

because we're all at home our dogs are

barking our life is out of control i

want to wear sweatpants all the time

right but it's that's what all of our

lives is and like you can't have this

conversation where like this person's

life is so different because we've all

been struggling and there's so much that

normalized that over covenant i think

took off the facade a bit of some of the

people that were trying to control their

image so much and made it just easier

for people to be like turns out this is

hard and that's okay and that's a

strength for me to say out loud you know

whitney do you feel like the pandemic

made you feel more comfortable to share

or um do you feel that that changed the

way you your you saw your social media

presence right you know what's crazy is

i i've always

struggled with mental health but i

really hit a couple of things happened

over the pandemic that really escalated

my mental health and so

it's it became a huge center center

focus for me and so yeah the pandemic

for me is really it's allowed me to be

more open and honest because there are

so many people it put all of us in such

a

an unknown territory in our lives and

and so many of us were in that same

position feeling very uneasy and so it

definitely allowed me and helped me feel

a little bit more safe sharing my story

online

i i appreciate you sharing that because

i think the in the pandemic we were kind

of in a state of

joint distress

right it was a mutual so much was

happening and i think that opened up the

door a little bit for these

conversations to be normalized right now

it's normal to say look being at home

and being isolated i'm so

um

you know i'm not feeling well i'm not

feeling like i should i'm feeling a

little depressed and

and growing those coping mechanisms i

think now that we're starting to come

back into the world

we're also dealing with a change right i

feel like during the pandemic i got i

got together such good coping mechanisms

i was riding my bike in the park i was

going to the gym

i was eating cooking all the time eating

right journaling and you come back to

the office with the commute and you're

like i don't have time for that anymore

um so for you what do you think dr jesse

will be what do you think is gonna

change now that we're coming out and

back into the world

oh big question again you know i mean i

think that we have this belief that

everything is now normal right that we

can just go back and pretend that the

past two years didn't happen and work is

gonna be the same and interacting with

friends and family is gonna be the same

it's not right so i think we have to

start with that which is there's going

to be an adjustment because you had to

adjust in the first place and a lot of

stuff happened right so maybe everything

didn't happen to you but you witnessed

it you read it you existed in the

society that was talking a lot about it

you just like sponge absorbed it right

so there's a lot of time to like let out

the sponge right and it's not gonna be

really easy and that's okay right so i

think there's a lot of like

speaking of media and social media just

like yay we're fine go back to normal

and it's okay if you don't resonate with

that message because it actually doesn't

make sense you should you if you're fine

you're fine and that's all right but

it's also okay if this isn't an easy

thing for you and there's a struggle to

transition right if there was a struggle

to transition on the one end there

probably will be on this one too right

so you talked about coping skills so

like for me i'm an extrovert literally

you took away my job which is talking to

people and socializing which was like my

majority coping skill and so i spent two

years trying to figure out how to enjoy

my own company for coping sake right and

like that's a hard thing and now i can

have people again and and it's

exhausting to be around people despite

being an extrovert right so it's like

how do you say like that's okay it turns

out i don't need to be around people all

the time and i can handle my own stuff

and i think that's going to be an

adjustment for people

yeah creating a new balance

i would definitely say that's something

i've been struggling more so with is i

am an introvert so

the transition for me was very

easy

and now i'm you know is

trying to navigate okay so i'm coming

out of this pandemic with newly

diagnosed depression i am on medication

i am still in weekly therapy i am

still doing these things every single

week so how do i transition back into

a different a different life for me

right now and so it's definitely

something that i've been struggling with

that transition and i think it's also

important to remember

it takes time and so i've been really

focusing on giving myself grace as as i

am beginning this new journey and it's a

journey that i'm that i'm on and pushing

through but we'll we'll get through it i

know it

i love that um phrase that you use and

it's a phrase i use it myself often give

yourself grace

you're oftentimes our worst critics you

know for me part of my anxiety was my

own pressure on myself to be perfect to

be really great at what i do

um to not show others how i was

struggling right and it was myself in my

head no one else was putting that

pressure on me and so i think i always

try to say when something doesn't go

quite like i would have hoped i said you

have to give yourself grace

and you also have to think about all the

things that are happening right

it's not just this is not there's only

one piece of your life you might have

family things going on you might have

personal things going on in addition to

work things all these things come

together

um

and could mean that your day gets

derailed or something went off the rails

but it's still probably going pretty

well

one thing dr jesse i would love to talk

more about is okay

if you do decide that you're ready

and you want to be vulnerable and you

want to talk to your family or close

friends or even you know the world

opening up to social media

what are some

steps that you can take as you get ready

to

have those conversations what are some

are there some words or

tactics that we could use before we have

these conversations and open ourselves

up to the world

yeah i think that first of all it's

important to acknowledge that it's not

an easy thing right so all the things

that you're feeling about talking to

people is a normal experience because if

you've never talked about it even to

your closest friends even to a doctor

it's gonna be hard to finally say like

this is what's going on in my life right

and talk to people about it so i just

want to acknowledge that and then you

know i think

where you do it and who you do it with

is important i think

you know

there are different locations that you

can have conversations with friends too

and family which feel more private i

think that finding a place where you

feel comfortable where the situation

feels safe with a person you feel safe

with is probably one of the most

important things because knowing that at

least the person has some awareness or

is going to react in a way that you feel

will be helpful is usually a good person

to start with you might end up having to

tell someone that isn't a person you get

along with as well or you have different

opinions from or your parent right that

might be a harder conversation sometimes

but for the very first time of talking

about it that person who's your person

find them talk to them say you know i

have something i need to tell you and

this is just tell them you know i think

feelings is a good place to start you

might not have to tell them i said in

the last session like your entire mental

health history you know like that's

scary like saying we've been on

medication like every single person on

this panel just said that

it is not a common thing for people to

talk about right like therapy is a lot

more normalized than medicine so i think

you know realizing that you can say to

your friend like i don't know what's

wrong with me but i feel like i'm

struggling or i've noticed that i'm not

doing work as well as i could or i'm not

going to school as much as i want to and

i don't know what it is but i'd like to

talk about it and i think just really

setting the stage for that conversation

in an open way with a person that you

really know is a person you can trust is

usually the best place to start

whitney you kind of started this

conversation talking about this friend

of yours

who really uh seemed to be your safe

space to have this conversation

i would love to hear what did this

person do for you how did they

uh make you feel safe for those people

who might be trying to create a safe

place for their friends well what's

crazy is she's not only my best friend

but she's also my hairdresser

and you know the feelings those start to

come out when you're sitting in the

chair

and

i i really had the first realization

that i needed help sitting in her chair

because she was just listening and

there's so much power just listening

and i

i didn't know how i was feeling like dr

jesse said i didn't i didn't i didn't

understand my feelings i didn't

understand why i was feeling this way i

didn't understand why i wasn't

doing as well

at work as i used to or as active as i

used to be and so just

sitting there and having her listen to

me and me just kind of talk is what

really initiated the process for me i

kind of reached that point where

i was alone in my own head for so long

and i was really in denial i just i

didn't want to accept or even understand

that i needed help and i needed somebody

just to talk to and talking to her was

that first initial step for me where

i got all my feelings out and i was like

i need

i need to do this more often i need to

find help and there's there are so many

people willing to help and to listen and

so that was that was the first step for

me she was just a great listener

the hairstylist has always been a great

place for therapy like

they're so good at being like oh really

oh my goodness you know they're just

like yes you're great at passing along

information

i i mean it's one of the reasons why i

got into beauty and i'm the energy for

velour is because that community that

you create at the hair salon is just

such a good one and i'm so glad to hear

that your stylist supported you in that

way i was in tears and she had my back

and my hair

and your hair and was like let me let me

hold your hair back and

i'm gonna blow out with those salty

tears

oh i love that dr jesse if we're

planning to be allies right if we want

to be good listeners for people who are

ready to tell their stories what can we

do to be better at listening and being

allies and pointing people in the right

direction if they're ready to share

yeah so nobody teaches you how to

respond to a friend who's struggling and

nobody teaches you how to be a friend

some of that is innate right like we've

just been around people and made friends

our life and we know what that feels

like or what we would want from someone

else right but i think the main thing is

what whitney said which is like listen

so we have a lot of urges when people

are talking and last session i said are

urges to give advice right and so when

when someone's struggling most of the

time they just want to talk there are

some times that they want an action or

you to do something about it but most

the time they just want a person to be

there to bear witness to whatever they

experienced and to say like you're there

and you will be there for them and you

will check in on them because they told

you that right it's mostly what i do in

my job right so i think people think you

go to therapy and like people are gonna

like magic one change everything you do

about your life but in a lot of ways

like what i do is listen and for most of

the pandemic i struggled a lot with the

fact that people's stressors were things

i couldn't fix like i couldn't give

people their jobs back or change the way

jobs where i couldn't make them healthy

and not that i ever did that before it

was just a lot more prevalent in my mind

and so i was like i'm not doing this

right and my therapist was like but you

don't have to fix them like you're just

there who else is there and i was like

that makes sense right and that's what

you do as a friend like you're just

there you don't have to fix it

that is such a good point i think

i'm definitely a type a fixer oh i love

to fix oh i love to be like okay

solution is this

um which is really good at work

but you know over this pandemic

i had a family member who was diagnosed

with bipolar disorder

and was really struggling

and wanting to jump in and fix it

wasn't quite the solution right

and

it really became hard for me as that

fixer in the family but then i also

i think

one thing i would love for us to talk a

little bit about is how those people

around those people who are dealing with

a recent diagnosis or a mental illness

or a not diagnosed mental illness

what do we do when we know someone needs

help

but they're resistant to getting help

is there anything that we can do do we

just step back and listen

or

you know what can we do dr jesse i don't

know

oh you know there are limits to

everything right so we wish that like

when someone's struggling that we can

make it all better or that we can get

them to help right away but some of that

is a choice right like they have to want

help of course there are reasons that

that becomes more complicated in my job

where you might be watching and saying

i've been in a situation where i got

help i didn't really want at the time

but hopefully it helped you ultimately

if you were in a hospital setting i mean

i think that what we're really doing is

just saying like i'm here

i will be here i will help you as much

as i can and

if i can't because it's like really

affecting me which makes sense that's

also okay and so having the ability to

balance both things and say like if

somebody's struggling i'm going to do

what i can to be there for them give

them help if they want it help in any

way that they ask for it or i can ask

them if i can give them suggestions you

know but in the same respect like i am

human i care about my friends so if my

friends are sad so am i if my family's

sick so am i right and

i'm allowed to have feelings about that

and manage them on my own so lots of

people who are caretakers need to go to

therapy themselves right like you might

be saying like well i've never struggled

which

awesome congratulations actually that's

great and i think that that happens for

some people right but sometimes like

your friends are struggling your

family's struggling and all of a sudden

you're like something's wrong with me

now because i've been holding all of

their stuff and they really do put it on

you that's what i do in my job too it's

like hold that for people right and so

you're allowed to have that affect you

like you're a human too so you can have

boundaries and

an effect of other people's lives on

yours

yeah i'm so glad you said that because i

think it's about creating boundaries

sometimes right you pour into other

people you hold things for other people

but then every once in a while you have

to say

whoa

it is too heavy i for my mental health i

need to drop some of this other stuff

and focus in on me because i can't help

others if i'm not at my best

um so i really appreciate you saying

that as someone who

dabbles in and is helping as a caretaker

and a family member um who's had to

endure sometimes um you know someone

who's still trying to be ready

i think that is such a good thing to

hear um that we're not always perfect as

caretakers as friends as allies but we

do our best because we do it out of love

i think one thing that comes to mind

with this discussion is

my friends and family they didn't know

and so

you know

when i talk to them after a long after a

long time of suffering in silence after

talking to them they don't know how to

help and that's okay but just knowing

that they are there and they are

listening and they're supportive and if

they need to set boundaries and take

breaks when they when they need to

it's it's still so it's been so

important and so helpful to me in my

journey so

thank you that's that's so good to say i

would love for us as we're wrapping up

here but for us all to share kind of

um

you know what are some things that we do

to

take care of our own mental health right

and some of those coping mechanisms that

we talked about earlier um how do we

stay on top of it

i would also love for you to share

what

speaking out has done for you personally

how has that helped you

whitney let's start with you

so speaking out for me personally has

truly

brought so much healing and connection

into my life i know i touched on that

earlier but

you

when you're struggling for me when i'm

struggling with i am struggling with

depression i do feel

very alone

and so

it was hard to share my story and once i

did once i was ready to share it

and you start talking to people and you

receive messages and you you feel so

understood so it brought a lot of

understanding into my life and i brought

a lot of just true deep connection and

healing

just a simple message to somebody saying

we're here for you we understand i feel

this exact same way it takes five

seconds out of your day to do that and

it truly has brought so much healing and

love into my life so i'm so grateful for

every single person who's gone out of

their way

to interact on my page with people who

are who are struggling because so many

of us are struggling and and sharing

that does bring such a deep connection

so for me my biggest thing that as we've

been transitioning back into being in

the office working every day you know

into this new way of life

i have promised myself that rain snow

sunshine i am on a walk every single day

sometimes it'll be at 9 00 pm and i drag

stefan with me

and

i always bring my dogs with me unless

it's raining i'll leave them behind

because they don't like the rain but i

will force myself every single day even

if i don't want to and i'm like stomping

getting outside by the end of that 30

minute 45 minute walk i feel a million

times better i'm off my phone it's it is

a breath of fresh air that has become so

important to me especially if i'm

running late and i don't have time to

journal that's been number one for me

and the biggest help for me is getting

outside and just walking and putting my

phone down

thank you so much disconnecting is such

a good tip dr jesse what about you

yeah i mean you know i was thinking

about when she was talking about sharing

her story how she felt alone before and

also depression itself makes you feel

alone like that's a symptom so it feeds

on itself right so if you aren't talking

with anybody about it your brain is also

saying you're alone like lots of pretty

negative thoughts about yourself and it

just compounds so keep in mind that

that's also probably the disease talking

at some point i think that for me

um you know sharing about mental health

as a healthcare worker who actually sees

healthcare workers has been

similarly important to be authentic for

me because i it seems unfair to say go

get help um when i'm not um or yeah sure

come in my office and i'm doing the

exact like opposite of things so i think

it's important to share that like

healers are imperfect too and that it's

okay that i am and i feel like the

reception has been good for a field that

doesn't talk a lot about their mental

health either and i think you know

there's an occasional troll or so but

not so bad which has been really nice

about

mental health sharing on social

especially for me but through writing in

general um

in terms of things i do for my mental

health so like therapy is number one for

me i go every week um

the second is actually stopping and

asking myself how i'm doing throughout

the day so i'm really bad at the like

brain body connection which

it might seem weird to you because

that's like basically my entire job but

you know when you work and all you do is

work all day you just get used to

ignoring both so you don't listen to

physical cues you don't listen to mental

cues and you just kind of exist and keep

powering through right and so i've been

spending a lot of time just stopping and

saying like wait how am i feeling like

both physically and mentally and just

saying those feelings out loud and like

leaving space for that not judging them

not trying to fix them not trying to

make any sort of crazy inference off of

it you know like

in a lot of ways we just are

dealing and so that's what i'm trying to

do make space to deal and count myself

in the conversation

thank you so much for sharing that and

i'll add for me i think

sharing my story with my family members

because i think someone in the chat said

how sharing with family is the hardest

part

and it is i come from a southern baptist

family

um therapy isn't a thing right and my

mother also deals with bipolar disorder

disorder and so she felt very isolated

within her family because they didn't

support her and so when i went to her

and told her that i also was feeling

anxious and um you know i didn't know

what was going on and i want to go to

therapy

we created such a tighter bond

and i literally can call my mom almost

at any time of day and be like i don't

feel good

and she'll be like i know

and that's it i don't have to explain

what i'm feeling i don't have to say why

i'm feeling bad it's just that i feel

kind of weird today and she's like oh me

too

and and that's such a great thing to to

have i think in someone who's close to

you and i think my friends have also

been very supportive and working through

and being able to say jessica this is

your anxiety speaking you are doing

actually really well getting some

perspective

um so i think that quote it's brought me

closer to my own friends and family by

being able to share and

recreate this own

new generation of acceptance

um that this past generation might not

have had and that has been so grateful

and and helpful for me

and as far as coping mechanisms i'll

have to say more medication sleeping

pills actually my um psychiatrist

prescribing sleeping pills

and that has helped me so much because

i'm that person that when i lay down

everything descends every thought is

something i should be doing something i

forgot to do something i'm like that's

been buried all day since i've been

moving but then pops up there at night

yeah so being able to take that sleeping

medication

has made it so much better because i'm

sleeping through the night

i can start the day with a fresh

brain instead of being so tired all the

time yes

i love that mm-hmm i need it i need some

of those well you know

dr jessica's going to hook us up to this

week i mean that is not my job of being

on this panel but i will say like sleep

and mark brought this up at the last

panel too which is like

we take for granted how much sleep

influences our life like i as a person

who talks about this stuff a lot in

patients is like okay you should sleep

and people are like thanks that's like

telling me to go eat healthier or

something right it's just like a thing

dr say but

when i don't sleep i'm angry or if i

don't sleep like i don't do work as well

but it takes me a while to realize that

and sleep is a really big thing if you

pay attention that you can actually

change if possible rather quickly to

make it better and you will feel better

you know and that's nice it's not a

thing that happens really easily with

other things absolutely

well thank you both so much dr jesse and

whitney for being with us today and

talking all about your personal stories

and being so open and vulnerable with us

we really appreciate that and i hope

everyone watching enjoys the rest of the

panel um

please join me in welcoming jay shetty

jay thank you so much for taking the

time and spending time with us today and

for being a powerful voice in all of

this work i am like many of us here

today a huge fan of yours and of course

an avid podcast listener

you've been such an inspiration to so

many people whether through your podcast

your book your public speaking events

and your story or at least what i've

been able to read and learn about it is

so fascinating can you start by just

sharing with our audience a little bit

about your journey to the work that

you're doing today

well first of all i'm so grateful and

honored to be here i'm such a fan and

admirer of the incredible impact that

you're all having so i feel really

deeply honored to be with you all today

and

i'll try and give you a short version

it's it's difficult to try and squash

the last 10 to 12 years into 30 seconds

but i'll do my best

my journey began as a student in london

who was inquisitive and curious but

didn't know where to start and so i

would go and hear

celebrities and entrepreneurs and ceos

and speakers about how they'd broken

through difficult times or how they'd

overcome failure and how they'd

overcome challenges in their lives

and once i ended up stumbling on hearing

a monk speak

and hearing this monk speak was one of

the most life-changing life-altering

moments of my life because he was the

first person that spoke about the need

for service he spoke about the need for

impact he spoke about the need for

contribution to the lives of others and

18 year old me was completely awestruck

about that concept and decided to spend

three years living as a monk when i

graduated from business school

in india and across europe and during

that time i built up some incredible

mental health habits without even

knowing that's what they were i

developed some really great tools and

insights to how to understand my

emotions and my feelings and how to

process them without knowing that that's

what i would do in the future and today

my biggest goal is to share those

lessons i learned from my mentors my

teachers

from the guides and coaches that i

studied with and try and make them

relevant accessible to everyone in the

world so when people ask me what i do

i describe it as wanting to help

everyone in the world find their purpose

and live up to their potential and

that's what i'm dedicated to that's what

my work is dedicated to

and it's come from a place of having

been truly gifted with some amazing

teachers and guides and wanting to share

that with the world

i love that and you better believe we

will be coming back to that question

later on so that you can share some of

those tips and wisdom with everyone in

the audience today

um so thank you for sharing that i love

that

so as you know we kicked off a campaign

for mental health awareness month called

your words matter and we've spent the

morning talking about how powerful words

are specifically as they relate to

talking about mental health they can

have a real impact on ourselves and and

and those around us

and you have openly shared and taught

millions of people about the power of

words through your work

i recently listened to a talk of yours

on why words are more powerful than you

think

can you tell us a little bit more about

this why why are words more powerful

than we may think

absolutely well words

are not just words they're ideas they're

concepts the definition of a word

defines how it moves us you could hear a

word that triggers you

or transforms you you could hear a word

that discourages you or empowers you

based on how you've interacted with that

word in the past the same word can be

seen so differently

by so many different people let's even

take a word like love

right a word like love that feels

universal that feels like we should all

have the same definition for it well

someone could say i love you and they

want to spend the rest of their life

with you and someone could say i love

you

and it doesn't always mean that and so

we find that even a word like love can

have so many definitions and meanings so

words matter even more the more they're

used the more accessible they are now

i came across this amazing study a few

years ago that really made sense of this

and it was conducted by harvard and it

was about emotional vocabulary

and they called it the emotions list but

i look at it as emotional vocabulary and

they said that there are five

ways most of us respond to the common

question

how are you and the five words are good

bad fine okay

so how's your day good how are you

feeling okay how are you doing bad

you know what are you looking forward to

next week i don't know like it's we we

have very

limited amount of words we use

to describe our emotions

and what harvard does and you can google

this after this session you can google

emotions list harvard on google and it

will come up with a table

and in that table it will give you

multiple words that describe a feeling

in more depth

so

when you're feeling sad are you sad or

are you feeling irritated or angry or

offended it goes deeper into the emotion

and what that does is when we can

diagnose how we feel more deeply we can

communicate that more effectively to the

people we love in our lives and when the

people we love in our lives understand

this they're able to better understand

our emotions as well so words carry

meaning they carry ideas they carry

feelings

and i really believe that we can all

expand our emotional vocabulary to have

healthier discussions

i love that and earlier today we heard a

little bit from dr mark brackett who

also sits on our rare beauty mental

health council and he talks all about

emotional intelligence and understanding

emotions and one of the things he always

starts with is

he'll say how are you and then he'll say

no how are you really yes so that we

really get an actual answer

that's not just

fine

okay

um so i love that

um so a recurring theme in a lot of your

work it is how words

can impact our reality

and in one of your videos you shared a

story around the power of words and you

left us with this takeaway and i'm going

to read it word for word so i don't mess

it up

if one word has such power to make you

so angry and hot

may not another word have the power to

heal

our words have more power than we

believe our words have the power to

impact our reality

we need to pick them carefully and make

sure you taste your words before you

spit them out

that's a powerful statement

how can all of us just be a little bit

more mindful

about our words in today's digital

fast-paced world

that's such a great question and it's

such a big challenge when i feel like we

read words hear words see words

all day

and it can feel like words are free and

they they somewhat feel free right it

feels free to spend words you don't you

don't think about that you don't go ima

imagine there was a limit on how many

words you could speak based on how much

time it cost or how much money it costs

and how much more valuable you'd feel

about them but even deeper than a

currency of money or time is the

currency of someone's feelings

and i think what really makes

us reflect for me especially

is in the book that i studied uh as a

monk it's called the gita there's

something inside of it called the four

guidelines for speech

and these guidelines really

are gateways or doors that i try and

walk through and i'll explain what they

are so the first one is is this truthful

right is this truthful is what i'm about

to say truthful

and the truth today is really hard to

decipher

from this perspective it would be is it

factual have we done the research have

we actually asked the questions have we

looked into this extremely deeply do we

actually know have we given it time to

digest so the first thing when before we

say something or write something or

whatever it may be is this truly factual

and if it isn't let's go do the research

let's go find the facts the second is

is the way i'm going to share it

beneficial to everyone this i found so

fascinating because it doesn't mean you

can't say it it's asking you to say are

you saying it in a way that will be

beneficial to a lot of people sometimes

you can say the truth but in a way that

no one can digest it

and that's sad because then the truth

doesn't get to win just because of the

casing that you put it inside of

the third question that you have to ask

yourself before you speak is

is this going to agitate anyone's mind

is this going to irritate anyone and

this is a great question again it's not

saying don't say things that are

sometimes going to agitate others or

irritate others but are we aware of that

are we conscious of that and are we open

to the fact that there may be someone

who may disagree with this or may have

some discomfort to this and are we

prepared to also answer that

and the fourth and final one is

ultimately

is what we're saying

uh coming from a good place in our heart

is it coming from a good intention

within our heart or is it coming from

what we know to be our lower selves and

and not our higher selves so to me those

are really great questions to almost use

those little doorways and gateways

before we speak

i love that if all of us just took those

few minutes before

we say something to connect our mind

with our words i feel like we we would

just live in a in a much more peaceful

and

joyful space and i think so much of what

you said is so relevant today

with the growth of social media and how

quickly people can post something say

something and not think through the

impact that it has on millions of people

i love that um

okay so we're gonna come to those those

tips and practices that you mentioned so

in your book think like a monk you

shared that we have about 70 to 80 000

thoughts per day and 80 of those

thoughts are negative

wow

so with current events a global pandemic

among other things going on more and

more people are commonly experiencing

anxiety stress and negative thoughts and

outlooks

what are some of the tips and practices

that you've learned that all of us can

can do to help us deal with our daily

realities to foster mental well-being

so what i love about having this

conversation with you is that if you

think about our thoughts they're words

our thoughts are words right i

feel a certain way or i'm thinking about

this or i'm worried about this like

thoughts are words

and not only do we have 70 to 80 000

thoughts per day and 80 are negative we

find that 80 are repetitive so it's

often the same thoughts that are going

round and round and round in our minds

and we often have the same thoughts at

the same time of day so we often have

the same thoughts before we go to bed

the same thoughts before

when we wake up

and so some of my practices would

include making sure that the first

thought of the day

and the last thought of the day

are consciously selected

you may not be able to control

the

799

thoughts throughout the day

that if we can start to feel a sense of

control over the first thought of the

day

and the last thought of the day it can

truly plant a seed that can change our

life and so when i wake up in the

morning i always want my first thought

my first seed of a thought to be a

grateful thought so for a long time what

i had is i had a little post-it note on

the side of my bed and it said what are

you grateful for and it would be the

first thing i would see

or i had a paragraph for my favorite

book open on my bedside table so i'd

wake up and i'd read the first three

lines or you have your favorite song

with your favorite lyrics that comes on

first thing in the morning so then songs

and music are a great way of programming

your mind to have a healthy thought so

it doesn't just have to be reading it

can be listening as well

and finally it could be a work of art

there may be a picture on your phone or

there may be a picture on your wall that

makes you feel a great thought so make

sure that the first thought of the day

and the last thought of the day are

powerful are grateful are positive and

those thoughts will start to have a

ripple effect as they start to multiply

i could give lots more advice but i

think that one's a a really great simple

practical one that people can start on i

love that one and i'm proud to say that

i'm trying that i started

using the five-minute journal a couple

of months ago so the prompts are the

same every morning and every evening and

they prompt you to do exactly that and

it it says no matter how tired you are

know how no matter how busy you are let

this be the first and the last thing

you do um so i'm trying i'm trying to do

that

that's amazing okay so we just have one

question to close us out um and that is

that you are of course someone who has

positively influenced millions of people

through the power of your own words

and

whether we have a platform of millions

like you or following like our founder

selena or we're just in conversation

with a family member or friends

how can each of us

thoughtfully influence others when it

comes to choosing words with intention

i think some of our greatest influence

happens not by speaking but by listening

and i think often the words that matter

the most are not the words we used but

the words we hear from others

and so i find that when i'm with my

friends or when i'm with my family or

when i'm in those intimate groups or

whether i'm on social media and online

i spend a lot of time

listening

and hearing the words that other people

are using i think words that other

people use can let you know how they

feel

i think words that other people don't

use can let you know how they feel words

they miss or skip as well words that are

not mentioned i just had this experience

yesterday where i was speaking to my

team on a zoom call

and one of the members of my team who

i've worked with for maybe two and a

half years now

i asked her how she was doing

and how she was really doing

and she was still hesitant to share

and i realized in that moment that there

was nothing i could say

to make her share something with me

and that would actually could feel

intimidating in that group setting

and so all i said to her was

i just want you to know i'm here for you

if you need anything and i realized that

me not saying anything else apart from

those words was actually able to open up

the space for her to tell me that

there's fires in her area and she's

worried about her children and and their

safety and

and it wasn't that my words could fix

her situation i think we often think

about words fixing things or solving

things

i don't believe words fix and solve

things i believe they hold and heal

things in people and so words are there

to hold space and heal not to fix and

solve and often that begins by listening

and hearing first

i hope that answers your question and

i'm so grateful for this beautiful

initiative and this amazing impact that

you're leading in this incredible

conversation on words i've i've been

doing this work for a long long time and

i don't think anyone's ever dedicated an

entire event to words and so i i love

you all for doing it i congratulate you

small part of it
