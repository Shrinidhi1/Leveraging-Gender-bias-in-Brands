hi everyone I'm backstage with boss and

we're getting ready for the Met Gala

[Music]

I'm not the best red carpet guy but I'm

working on my poses and I'm Gonna Be

Ready To Roll

so look in my room I'm looking like a

true boss that he is it has a special

link to car Locker back in 1998 Carla

guffel wrote a letter to then creative

director of boss and now you can see the

letter embroidered on the scarf so it's

a pretty iconic it's beautiful

thank you
