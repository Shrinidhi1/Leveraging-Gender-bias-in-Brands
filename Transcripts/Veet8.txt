we can pose all we want make posts of

our favorite instant moments of where

we're standing what we're eating and

what we did last night what's so great

about that moment when it's so expected

what happened to capturing real life

what happened to capturing a spontaneous

moment

seeing beauty in our actions not alone

explore every moment

jumpin Tod

live unforced because when you live life

carefree is beautiful
