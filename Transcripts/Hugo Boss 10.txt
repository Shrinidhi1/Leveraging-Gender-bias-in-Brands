when I wake up early I feel like the

whole day belongs to me

my name is Jace lanes eval 60% of my job

is traveling packing smart means you

bring not too much stuff but it needs to

be interchangeable you need to be able

to mix match everything that you have I

will pack a pair of white sneakers maybe

a white t-shirt with me it's always nice

to have something you can put on and go

on your day even LA has its rainy days I

always make sure to bring a coat just in

case if the weather change it makes a

huge difference to travel with garments

that don't crease

I see people at the airport carrying

their suits trying desperately not to

crease them I'm not one of those people

what I love about traveling is absorbing

different cultures makes you who you are

that's a really powerful thing
