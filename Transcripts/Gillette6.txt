helping guys be at their best is what we

do

we know that shaving is not necessarily

what guys look forward to every morning

in fact guys go to great lengths to make

their shave the better experience we

know that heat and warmth are constant

variables in that search for a better

shape

consumers tell us that the epitome of a

shaming experience is a hot towel shave

something that only a few guys are able

to indulge in once in a while that's why

we're introducing

our first heated razor

[Music]

a racer that makes the comfort of hot

that will shave accessible to guys every

morning

we've traveled the world and immerse

ourselves in the culture of heat and

warmth we've also learned how these

sensations are applied in an intentional

way to create indulgent experiences

heat has an extensive history in

personal care it helps to reduce the

effects of pain it increases blood flow

the warming bar heats up in less than a

second and distributes an even and

soothing warmth to the skin

the for intelligent heat sensors

continuously reheat the Worman ba to

maintain a safe and consistent

temperature Gillette has pioneered some

major shaping innovations that we had

the opportunity to incorporate into this

razor flex disk technology which helps

to maintain skin contact in order to

give a smooth shave but also to maximize

the heat delivery

design the razor to be waterproof so you

can even use it in the shower

the magnetic charging stands makes sure

it's easily accessible and always

charged

we want to bring the product to

consumers much earlier than we have done

traditionally so that we can incorporate

the early feedback into this new

platform and ensure that we are

delivering an elevated grooming

experience

scheanette laughs is all about

reinventing the experience of shape

and he's just the beginning

you
