I was born with a condition called

osteogenesis imperfecta it's a genetic

disease and it caused my bromas to be

very brittle I will break frequently

like people attacked me and I will break

by age 18 I broke over 200 times growing

up I never saw anyone that looked like

me on any platform I do run into adults

sometimes older than me that look at me

like I'm strange or just kind of be rude

and that's kind of just comes with the

territory and you get used to it

unfortunately I try not to let it down

for me because it just happened so much

that if you did I feel like I just

wouldn't be in a good place mentally

when I graduated from college I actually

was having a really hard time getting

hired from companies whether it be

because of the world share cuz the

places were inaccessible with some

people as soon as accessible is not

always really accessible that's one of

the challenges you face because the

world unfortunately is not made for

wheelchairs my mom I do remember always

said is it's important to kind of know

yourself for yourself and this is not

just in the physical aspect it's all

aspects like when I look in the mirror I

have to be happy about who I see as long

as I'm happy who I see when I go out in

the world it didn't really matter what

someone says but someone does because I

Know Who I am beauty comes in so many

different forms I want everybody to

understand there's always some beauty

aspect to you

the first time I ever went into sofware

was at age 12 I'm gonna play with

everything that's in the store and

figure out like what your makeup look is

gonna be it's kind of like you just went

into this little fantasy world in a way

that's one of the reasons why I love

Sephora and I do love being able to play

with the perfumes though different

colors it's just a bigger ating I guess

is the right word to describe a family I

do try to find that one makeup product

that will make my makeup kind of pop

like today I'm wearing eyeliner to kind

of showcase another ideal beauty that

maybe other people didn't see even

though I didn't have that I want to be

that for someone else

I thought a lot of people would be very

surprised that I do so many things

independently I live on my own I Drive

on my own I own the business I always

had a love for 13 but I didn't really

twisted into an actual business until I

went to college and I discovered like

there's people I actually don't know how

to thrift that's what kind of birthed

golden rags it just started as a hobby

turned into a love turned into a

business I just was my organic self to

get here I didn't have to change who I

was how it looked what I did you can be

you and still get where you need to be I

got here just by be me
