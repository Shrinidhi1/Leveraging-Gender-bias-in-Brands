this beard I have not shaved it for the  last I'll be completing 10 years next  year my name is nikhil and what else you  want to know  if Interruption is starting  anyway trimming is something that I  follow every day  [Laughter]  what's hot viewers missed me  and I'm on the lookout for hunky men  with Gorgeous beards to learn a thing or  two about their pure grooming habits in  association with the man company so come  let's ask around what beard style do you  find sexy  um I think it's French only because I'm  that's the only thing I can grow  actually so I like the French beard yeah  long beard one with the cone that I find  sexy  are you are you aiming for that yeah  yeah yeah I'm aiming for that raw don't  do anything about it  just the one I'm uh wearing right now  the one beard sir it should be trimmed  uh like my style only which I have  recently any beard like I think it's the  base level is that if it's a beard  that's all it takes yeah it just has to  how about I think I like a stubble no I  I think I like the caveman thing better  like the full grown not very long but a  subtle look  what do you prefer uh for your own  styling an old school razor blade or an  electric shaver uh electric trimmer  electric shaver for me I think an old  school's razor because I don't really  use the entire thing the electric one so  yeah oh electric shaver and electric  shaver  uh easier to use and you can get it on  the get-go that's that electric shaver  definitely that gives Supercuts uh old  school yeah yeah old school razor blade  which has both sides I think uh electric  shaver because it is less uh you know  work for me what is the one beard  routine that you follow every day  I think trimming  trimming is something that I follow  every day  [Laughter]  that you guys have a lot  not at all not at all not at all no I  don't follow every day like it's one in  a month once in a month or that way not  every day I feel that beards are  supposed to be scruffy it's supposed to  be like a anti-establishment thing so  like not doing anything about it it like  that's the routine I follow  I apply oil  nothing really I don't have any weird  routine  yeah yeah  maybe just uh you know if it goes out of  shape I just cut it with a pair of  scissors awesome uh I put oil on my  beard the beard oil that's for sure  every day every day I don't have a  routine  like you said yeah yeah every day I just  wash my beard properly and then clean it  and share like uh combat  just to give that shape  so hygiene basically the most important  yes I usually apply beard oil but that  too if I grow that long but normally  again like current this current look is  very short I'm making this I trim like  every week so I don't have to put a oil  or shampoo or such  name one celebrity who's beard you  absolutely love or you wish you had a  beard like that I like it it has to be  Hrithik Roshan and think of anyone right  now  so there's Yash obviously then  there is Vicky kosher then we sing  then yeah  and then there is a little bit of  stubble and yeah those are the top few  yeah I think I like Virat kohli's beard  actually that for me like that is like  perfectly well groomed one so yeah but I  can't get there so anyways  ranveer Singh Maybe  I think Bradley Cooper  he has a good beard  Shahid Kapoor always and racing I've not  thought about it but wait uh  uh Tom Hardy commodity he's got a good  proper full here  [Music]  one beard style for the rest of your  life  what would it be either a mustache or a  full long beard or long beard  that looks super good on me because I  look like a baby in clean shape no  mustache no clean ship yeah both  Colombia  [Music]  yeah  and not only the Mustachio I would like  to sport a mustache because I did one  recently so I think I like to choose  with the mustache with this one that's  unique  I don't like mustache it's just two  maybe I like it I may look like an uncle  if I grow a mustache so you know that's  right yeah long beard if I could grow  one  that's the problem yeah but long beard I  think yeah don't start shaving yourself  too young trim it first and then start  shaving yourself so that you have a even  hair growth and um  it just helps you in the longer run  because grass is not always greener on  the other side DIY I would suggest DIY I  think if you rely on someone else to do  this that's not the best way to go about  it best is if you do it yourself  probably trimming every day is something  that's good because it'll give you a  better growth I feel and I don't use a  conditioner as of now but I think yeah  we use a conditioner to you know the  stubble won't be so hard it'll be soft  so it'll be exactly so yeah I think  that's about it shame every week  trim every week and put shampoo or  weirdo is a must  um just go to the salon you know just  don't do anything on your own I would  say because if you mess it up then  you'll have to clean everything off and  then you'll have to wait till it yeah to  grow back yeah that's that's the main  thing I would say what is what is the  one beard grooming product that you  absolutely swear by  well the man company I guess  I think beard oils beard oils from time  to time it's good for just maintaining  your beard and regular basis so that's  something else I think a beard  conditioner  yes yeah I guess I'll start using it  maybe then our bonus question for you  uh like I said I like a stubble no no  never clean shaving so clean shaven men  look naked to me I think the face has to  be you know it's like the gay now of men  more than Myriad a clean shaven and why  any comment on that bye I feel them to  be young without fear could not exactly  stumble a bit more than that but I think  a full beard is just way too much I like  more of like a youthful but not too  boyish sort of look today I've had so  much fun talking to people about their  beards and grooming habits I really hope  you guys enjoyed watching
