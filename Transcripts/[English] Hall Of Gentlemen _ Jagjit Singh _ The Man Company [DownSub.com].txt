while you are watching this video from  all the comfort of your home there must  be some furry little friends roaming  around your house looking for warmth is  there someone who finds Comfort by  giving and is actually doing something  for all the stray dogs who yearn for a  home meet Mr jagjit Singh working hard  to restore faith in humanity since 2019  my name is jagjit Singh I'm an  industrialist we get raw materials from  everywhere throughout the globe in fiber  drums these fiber drums were basically  discarded to the scrap dealer the  passion for dogs was always there in my  mind I always used to wonder what I can  do for this trade-off because I could  see them in pain all the time in Winters  so one day in the factory I saw one dog  sleeping inside the drum which clicked  an idea into the mind and suddenly I put  up four drums in the car and got them  home  and I place them outside my house and to  my store is that these drums were  occupied  by four Strays of my Lane  so this idea was like something which  struck my mind I said let us let us do  something because the drums were getting  wasted in the factory and uh the best  use we could make out from these drums  was that to make a house first race  so I clicked the photo I sent it to my  residential groups in dlf gurgaon was  liked by so many people that I got a  huge demand I offered them okay I'll  give you for free so that is how the  journey started so from since 2019 I am  doing this and every year in Winters  from October to February we do this dog  houses while some may have felt that  they had done enough Mr jagjiji could  only think about his next steps tell us  about all these birdhouses jagjichi when  we remember our childhood  but over the years I was seeing that  they are declining now  could find out a vendor who can make  these houses for me is  just my dlf area I try to promote it and  people really like the idea and almost  every house in dlf I gave that uh  Sparrow house and people thanked me and  many came and thanked me in such a way  so that was an achievement  at least just just a small message  and depression is gone from the house  what is your next step sir my next step  is to spread the awareness about the  Sheltering of animals and birds and also  spreading awareness regarding adoption  of Australians  to do this  all you need is effort and love nothing  else  [Music]  [Music]
