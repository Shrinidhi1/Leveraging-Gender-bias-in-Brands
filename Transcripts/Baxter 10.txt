Be honest.

Be vulnerable.

Be yourself.

Talk about your feelings.

It's like we so are worried about this outside appearance
and putting up this wall of like who we

have to be to be accepted and it's just
like, it's just suchâ€”it's BS, you know?

And it's like, just being true yourself and
not trying to be someone else.

Because that's a waste of a life.
