- As men, we love experimenting

with different facial hairstyles,

and trying out different looks.

In this video, we'll take you
through step-by-step process

on how you can try out different looks

from a beard to a goatee, to
a mustache, to a clean shave.

Step one, wash your face
and apply your shaving gel

to the sides of your face
and parts of your neck.

Step two. Now, with the
razor, shave off the sides

of your beard and neck.

We recommend using Gillette Fusion.

The five-blade technology
gives you a closer shave,

and its flexball adjusts

to the contour of your face,
getting rid of every hair.

The Gillette Fusion comes
with a precision trimmer

which helps you shape your side locks

and French beard perfectly,
getting rid of all the hair

that is hard to reach.

Now that we've showed you how
to get a goatee from a beard,

let's move on to getting
a mustache from a goatee.

Step one, wash your face
and apply the shaving gel

on the chin and to the side of the lips.

Step two, shave off the hair
on your chin and side lips.

The FlexBall Technology on the
new Gillette Fusion adjusts

It also comes with a precision trimmer

that helps removing hair

from those hard-to-reach places.

Step three, shape the edges

of the mustache and get
rid of excessive hair.

The precision trimmer

of Gillette Fusion helps
shape your mustache perfectly.

Now that we have shown
you the mustache look,

let's move on to the simple,
quick, clean-shaven look.

Step one, wash your face,

and apply shaving gel on your mustache.

Step two, shave off your mustache.

The FlexBall Technology on the
Gillette Fusion helps adjust

to your face, giving you a cleaner shave,

and the five blades help cut
all the hair effectively,

giving you great results.

Wash your face with cold water,

and make sure no spot
is left to be shaved.

Finish off with an aftershave

for a complete shaving experience.
