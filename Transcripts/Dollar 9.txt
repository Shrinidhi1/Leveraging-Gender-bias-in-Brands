[Music]

welcome back to another episode of the

ones who succeed

I'm Campbell Barron and today I am

joined by my wonderful guest Michael

Dubin so Michael is the founder and CEO

of Dollar Shave Club and for the few

people who do not know a Dollar Shave

Club is Dollar Shave Club is an online

subscription service that ships men's

razors and shaving accessories on a

monthly basis for a very affordable

price

Dhar shave club has over four million

members worldwide he was acquired by

Unilever in 2016 Michael I appreciate

you taking the time to talk to me thanks

for joining us so like most people I

found out about Dollar Shave Club to the

hilarious add our blades are great and

we'll get to that in a sec but I just

want to start this off with Kentucky

about where you came from your childhood

where'd you grow up I grew up just

outside of Philadelphia in a suburb

called Bala Cynwyd and then my family

moved to Bryn Mawr when I was probably

13 or 14 mm-hmm and what were you like

as a kid let's see as a young kid I I

was very I had a lot of hobbies or at

least I thought I had a lot of hobbies I

was hard to hold my attention because I

was into a little bit of everything

what about school did you enjoy it were

you a good student I was not a great

student you know like I said it was kind

of hard to keep my attention I was kind

of into whatever it is that I was into

and usually that was sports or you know

theater or the extracurriculars and yeah

I would say I was not the world's most

amazing student

so let's fast-forward a little bit like

when did you realize when do you realize

you wanted to be an entrepreneur you

were interested in that well I think I

always I think when I was younger I

always was interested in in selling

things I remember when when I was young

my sister and I and some of the kids in

the neighborhood we we would grab some

of my grandmother's stuff off the shelf

some books and some other odds and ends

and we would bring them out to the

street and put them on a table and just

kind of sell them to people driving by

and that was super fun

you know I don't I I don't know why I

found it particularly fun but there was

just something inherently exciting and

and and fun about about taking things

that other people you know found value

in and selling it to them and so that

was that was a fun experience I think

from a very early age I was I was into

that idea so Michael started his career

working for NBC in the media industry

however while working the day job he was

always coming up with new business ideas

like a tourism social network that he

started in 2006 but it didn't go very

far

that being said instead of quitting

altogether and giving up on

entrepreneurship

Michael simply brushed it off and that

really interests me so you started this

kind of tourism social network right

before Dollar Shave Club and I presume

really people said it's not gonna

succeed or it's gonna fail and I guess

they were right mm-hmm and but with

Dollar Shave Club people said that it's

not gonna succeed and it's and it's

gonna fail right and they were really

wrong so how do you know when to quit

how do you know when a bad idea is a bad

idea

it's a great question and I get this

question a lot I think it's I guess it

comes down to qualifying why your idea

isn't working is it work is it not

working because there really is no

consumer need for it or is it not

working because it's too hard for the

consumer to really understand what it is

that you're selling which can be the

case with a lot of service style

businesses or or apps even it's like

what's the usefulness for this you know

product so to speak is it not working

because you just kind of haven't gotten

the word out yet and it is a great

product and there is a product market

fit there are a lot of reasons why

something might not be working I think

is not working because you know you

don't have the right talent I think it's

important kind of always to look at why

it's not working and and dissect that

and dissect that as deeply as you

possibly can because the answer of

whether you should keep going or if you

should put it down for a little bit and

weight is always in the kind of why it's

not working there's there's a lot of

ideas that didn't work the first time

around in society and then 15 years

later people try them again and then

they work because the market had time to

catch up and sometimes an idea is just

too early that's that's that can be a

reason why it's not working you're just

too early to market you're ahead of the

market so I think that you have to be

really you know rigorous in your

analysis of why it's not working and

then decide whether or not it's worth

stopping or continuing so I asked

Michael one of my favorite questions is

entrepreneurship talk or are you born an

entrepreneur hmm is this because

everybody has business ideas right so

it's not it's more than just having the

actual business execution you have to be

able to with limited resources sort of

find a way to get the critical work done

and bring the project along you don't

have to bring it all the way home but

you have to be able to you know kind of

solve critical problems and weave it all

together to get an early beta version

lives yeah and so I think that's

probably the the critical skill is can

you can you argue a really good problem

solver whereas some people you know

you'd ask them to go figure out one of

the early things we had to do in DSC was

figure out how we're gonna ship right

and I don't have a logistics and

shipping background so what did I do I

said okay well that's a problem that can

be solved I'll just start at the post

office right and I'll start by googling

how do I ship my products and sure

enough there were a list of services

there that we're offering and you know

you test each one and you negotiate the

best rates and you go on and on but you

know you say to yourself how am I going

to weave all this together and solve the

critical problems and to me that's what

an entrepreneur does really well I think

you have to have certain traits to be

able to certain character traits

endemically that can't be taught to to

be able to be a successful entrepreneur

I think one of them one of those traits

is you have to be

relentless in in your commitment to

solving the problem almost to an

addictive level it's like nothing's

gonna stand in your way because you're

addicted to this notion of solving the

problem and bringing the thing to life

and then I think another one is seeing

you have to see how you can uniquely

weave together a plus B to equal D right

yeah and and that's something that not

all people have coming up I continue my

conversation but first a quick message

[Music]

so fast-forward a couple years and

Michael realizes a new business

opportunity he notices that the

experience of purchasing razors is

flawed and in most cases where there's a

problem there's a solution

I had always sort of bristled at the

price of razors and then the shopping

experience and you know I would milk the

same old razor over and over again

because it was you know easier to do

that than to go out of my way and spend

20 minutes to get these razors and you

know that was kind of when I was living

in New York where he had to walk by a

hundred drugstores on your way home from

from the office and then I you know I

had the good luck to bump into a friend

whose father had a warehouse full of

razors and that gave me the opportunity

to sort of test that concept that was a

few years later so Michael did test the

concept and launch the site with the

hilarious video explaining what it does

hi I'm Mike founder of

dollarshaveclub.com what is

dollarshaveclub.com well for $1 a month

we sent high-quality razors right to

your door yeah a dollar are the blades

any good

no our blades are great you know I wrote

that video because I had sketch writing

training and I asked a woman that was

also a friend of mine who I had who I

had studied with that in New York to

direct it and we shot it over the court

I wrote it over the course of a month we

shot it over the course of one day and

you know we edited it and we launched it

in March 2012 and I don't think any of

us were expecting it to go viral but I

think that what made it go viral was the

combination of a few different things

one was the content was good number two

was it was actually tied to a business

that actually solved the real problem

for guys which is that you know razors

were overpriced and the shopping

experience was pretty frustrating so so

it wasn't just like a funny video there

was a lot of funny videos in the

internet it was the fact that it was a

funny video coupled with this with it

with this business concept and I think

that's what sort of propelled it forward

each razor has stainless steel blades in

a levira lubricating strip and a pivot

head it's so gentle a toddler could use

it and do you like spending $20.00 a

month on brand-name razors 19 go to

Roger Federer

I'm good at tennis and then so you

launch with this video you created it

and how did you it blew up it you've got

a bunch of orders or people a bunch of

sign up after it aired how did you find

this how did that did you was it

self-funded did you raise money from

grace a little bit of life self-funded

it up until probably January of 2012 and

then we closed our first round of seed

funding which is a hundred thousand

dollars from an investor in Santa Monica

and yeah and that was and then but when

that was before the video went that was

all before the video went live and then

it went live do you think your razor

needs a vibrating handle a flashlight a

back scratcher in ten blades your net

sum asked grandfather had one blade and

polio and then it went live well we had

also we'd also then sorry we'd raised a

hundred thousand in January and they

were a psych I think a million dollars

right at the beginning of March and then

after that video launch a few months

later were raised about ten million

dollars yeah so then it launched and

then what happened and then we sold out

of inventory the site crashed it was

sort of a scramble you know I think I I

think I blacked out for six months while

while we just sort of scrambled to keep

everything going and hire a bunch of

people and scale up and and then go out

and raise more venture capital did the

site crash scare you or did it excite

you like that sound that's like the

probably one of the best problems you

can have it is I mean I thought that it

was going to be I thought that it was

going to be stopped paying for shave

tech you don't need and stop forgetting

to buy your blades every month Alejandra

and I are gonna ship them right to you

we're not just selling razors we're also

making new jobs Alejandra what were you

doing last month not working what are

you doing now waking I'm no Vanderbilt

but this train makes hay

I don't think any of us were expecting

the site to crash or for us to get as

much traffic as we did so clearly we

were unprepared for that but yeah I

think that's a scary moment because

you're you know you're in this one

moment you're you have this massive

success this unexpected success and then

you think well I might not be able to

cash in on it however as you know Dollar

Shave Club did cash in on it

and not just with revenue because in

2016 Unilever acquired the company for 1

billion dollars so you're building this

company you have a bunch you probably

have a bunch of users and then how did

that happen how did did you did you

approach Unilever did Unilever approach

you how did that we met at a dinner I

met one of their senior executives at a

dinner we started talking about the

industry and where we wanted to go and

have that complement it's one of their

own sort of strategic visions to reduce

their strategic imperatives to reduce

their you know reliance on traditional

retail and there was a lot of

opportunity for us to go further and go

further faster with them as a partner so

we like you mentioned earlier on you

have tons of ideas you seem like the guy

who has tons of ideas where do you were

used to yourself in 10 years

well in 10 years I'll be 50 and I can't

say for sure I'd like to say that I've

been able to maintain a successful

business track record whether that's

here or somewhere else probably have a

family and be able to give back in in in

measurable ways because I think that

anybody that's successful noblesse

oblige they they need to they need to

give back all right oh Michael I

appreciate you taking the time to talk

to me thanks for coming out appreciate

it

we are dollarshaveclub.com and the party

is on

I never did this for fame or glory or

any of that I wanted to start businesses

because you know I like to create and I

like to build and I've always wanted to

find a way to do that you know I think I

think most people as you talk to people

who started things they really if I

think I really believe it's a calling

mm-hmm like you get the message and you

pick up the phone and you answer the

call and then you go do it and there's

really no question
