If we're from here, from SoCal, we have heart for it, like this is our place—this is our coast

This is us right here—this is our style, this is our everything

What I love about LA? The culture. It's like everyone is kind of united. Everyone coexists with each other

Don't care what people think of you just continue to do what you do

and don't be focused on what other people in your head

Now that I'm where I'm at in my life, you know, I'm completely myself and I know that my homies don't judge me

for who I am and the person that I am exactly the way that I'm supposed to be

I had a little bit of a rough past, but being true to yourself is the most important—knowing who you are
