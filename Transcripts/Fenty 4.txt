[Applause]

it's so exciting to see all of you here

welcome to my first ever artistry class

and beauty top fancy beauty before we

get any further though I would love to

introduce to you guys my two pros who

are gonna be helping me out today

Priscilla oh no my boy Hector ah so

today's gonna be fun feel free to ask

questions about of course what we're

doing no sneak questions and just

remember it's my first time so don't be

so hard on me okay all right let's get

started first I'd like to bring some

models out so we can start doing some

makeup would you like to see that let's

do it yes yes we're gonna start off with

the Fenty face the first step Hector

we're gonna start off with a soft matte

base using our pro filter primer have

you guys use this before

isn't it amazing you like it thank you

well when I was making it I really

wanted it to be something that just felt

really feminine and it wanted to be a

pinky nude that just had this really

nice smell and I wanted it to also feel

supple something that felt comfortable

to the skin and it works on every

complexion as you can see how does that

feel Halima

I like to wait until the product just

like sets into the skin of it the primer

and the foundation no there's no rule

with that because they actually marry

really well together so they're man to

even mix if you want to like shear your

foundation out even more just drop a

pump a primer in there you do that this

is perfect

yeah our lake when you go into the beach

oh you know like your boyfriend's coming

over you don't want to know that your

room makeup but it's there that all

right so we're gonna move on to the next

step which is our lovely delicious Pro

filter soft matte foundation so have you

guys tried the pro filter foundation

before yeah now when I was making this

formula I mean I have a really big pet

peeve about getting greasy who has a pet

peeve about me especially in pictures

right you're gonna red carpet in 5,000

pictures later you're like what happens

so I made this foundation just for that

so when you get hot for when I'm on

stage performing from when I'm just all

day out and I don't have time to reapply

you want something that makes you look

like you your makeup was just done five

minutes ago always comes in a range of

colors of I'm sure you've heard 40

shades we started with and so there's a

color for everyone in here the first

woman I've seen put on makeup was my mom

and she's darker than I am so to think

that I would make a line that wouldn't

include even her it just I couldn't do

it she was the first image of beauty

that I've known you know so it was a

no-brainer for me but it's a shame it

took this long for everyone but I hope

that everyone can expand and wake up I'm

using 180 180 and halima was Halima's

number three ninety three ninety look at

how mad this is it already looks like

she's powdered and there's nothing but

foundation on her skin but it still

looks like skin it doesn't look over

powdery which I love because I don't

like makeup to look like makeup on top

of skin I just like it to look like

perfect skin

talk about the brush Priscilla I call it

a little paw this brush is so epic I use

this for foundation I use it to prep the

skin I use it for blush sometimes it's

literally the perfect brush I think

because of its density it just blends

the foundation and seamlessly and

quickly like I'm always on the way out

the door so you just want something that

you can dip in that and dip in that and

use in different parts of your face and

in different areas and on different

products for different finishes this is

one of those brushes what I'm using now

is the sponge there's many things that I

love about this sponge for me I've never

want to put a but a sponge down that

just rolls off to the shape is so good

because with the flat side you really

can capture a big area and the cut is so

unique because it really allows you to

go around the nose area around the lip

area especially I'll give you retouching

throughout the day it doesn't disturb

what you already have done I'm using a

sponge damn what it really does is

mimics the skins texture so allowing the

foundation to really look and feel like

skin this right here I usually like to

use that corner for like really really

tight under the eye this is really good

for powder the flat side it's also

really good for applying foundation but

I'm I like to do this this site as well

when it comes to foundation I like to

keep it rolling around so you could just

put it on really heavy and just blend it

out huh that's why it's cut yeah I

wasn't trying to save money we've

actually method to the madness all right

the next step and one of my favorite

little prod matte stick to set it yes

you're right the packaging is one of my

favorite things about this product you

could dump all of this into one bag it's

not moving anywhere it's not getting

uncovered it's all slammed together and

perfect what color are you gonna use

right now I'm going to use the color

espresso espresso my ultimate favorite

like I use it as an eye shadow lips

contour such a universal color and it

was great on all skin tones I like to do

contour first because it allows me to

really just shape the face show them

what you working with

given that jaw lines right I'm gonna

start with concealer first we like to

warm it up on the back of our hand

to kind of warm it up and activate it a

lot of people when they first go into

their matchsticks they notice that they

might be a little bit dry but that's

what they're supposed to be like because

they do have more of that soft matte

finish so a little trick to get it

creamy just activated by warming it up

on the back of your hand and then you're

going to see boom color payoff so rich

but then when it dries down it just like

locks into the foundation and it lasts

all day and it won't budge

so I'm going into contour next so I'm

gonna mix a couple I'm gonna mix a

little bit of amber and a little bit of

suede to kind of get the cool but

forgets about our amber because amber is

a people look at this and they get a

little scared right it looks great right

you're a pro if you're asking all the

right questions you're not scared of

amber thank you

all right so Priscilla's gonna show you

guys how to use amber cuz it's not that

scary yet it's like the perfect cool

tone contour for fair skin a lot of the

times I feel like fair skin also gets

overlooked and contours can sometimes be

to oranjee or be to golds but Rihanna

made the perfect undertone and the

perfect tone for contour so since Vitas

in the 100's but she's in the later 100

so she's fair skin but just a little bit

of color so I'm actually just gonna mix

in a tiny bit of warmth to it but it's

literally the perfect contour if you

just want that sucked in chisel cheeks

show them the jawline like get into that

over there you want to see that goodness

it just gives you that perfect shadow

for my skin tone I'm 270 whoo and I

suede is like my perfect color it's not

too warm and it's not too cool it's like

the perfect tone for me I like to do

conceal laughs just because I feel like

one of the things that wears off the

quickest so what I'm doing here is using

the color wheat and I'm using over my

all over blending brush and my sponge I

like to go a little bit lighter and then

slowly go ahead and

I want to choose a little bit her cheeks

I want to go underneath it questions

about the matchsticks feel free all

right let's get her a question I don't I

set things with powder and I actually

made these formulas specifically so you

don't have to bake and do all of that I

like as little steps as possible

I like to just get to it you know thank

you thank you thank you so much are we

gonna go highlighting or mattifying you

like to mattify first right I'm that way

I'm that way also just so you know

there's no rule to that you can do

either you know I think that fancy

beauty is actually rethinking the way

you do makeup and today we wanted to

show you how you can do a full glam look

but still make the skin look like skin

we are not gonna bake we just use our

invisible powder I'm gonna show you guys

it literally goes straight to this

perfect matte I think this product is

pretty genius because you can use it on

any skin tone so don't be afraid of this

color it's like perfect

this is actually one of my favorite

products as well the invisi matte powder

as I tell you I am anti grease I love do

but I do not like grease but it really

gets that t-zone down and it doesn't

leave that really white residue it looks

white it looks scary but with your

application it can just disappear this

is why I designed products like this

because I can't walk into an award show

with a clutch full of makeup you just

need a couple things and usually by then

it's only the invisible adding powder

cuz I do sweat through my makeup

specially on stage and stuff like that

but the pro filter soft matte foundation

when I tell you this product is a dream

and it was tailor made specifically for

things like that cuz I can't reapply my

makeup in between songs you know like I

can't go back there for an hour and

start over so I have to make sure

there's something I can just pat pat pat

or block and and keep it moving right

here look at that and if you don't

believe me look at it

Oh

Alima whoa butter butter so I like to

play with the sponge I feel like my

whole life change because it's so easy

to use you just really does absorb all

the shine so gorgeous and your skin is

not fair just so you know not fair

I want to let add a little color to the

cheek I'm gonna use a little shimmer

stick so I'm gonna use the match sticks

in the shimmer formula so we have 30

total 20 are Matt and 10 have shimmer so

the shimmer ones I like to mix and match

and use them as highlight and flushers

as well and these are the fun ones you

have to warm it up to get it activated

into that nice movement something that

you can apply move around but then once

it's there it sets into this really dry

nice finish

leaving the dew still there on your skin

you can put it on your cheek you can

apply it into your eyes your nose bridge

depending on what kind of day you're

having you can even put it on your

collarbone depend on what you're wearing

or what you like to highlight it's

really flexible and I like flexible when

it comes to makeup because I don't think

there should be any rules makeup is fun

this color is bright and it's meant to

be played with and you should not be

afraid of it cuz it could come off in

seconds so don't be afraid to go there

you know and try something new and the

best part is that it doesn't budge it's

like the most genius product but still

has that really beautiful sheen this is

my favorite combination right now it's

rum and yacht life so I did a little bit

of rum on the cheeks but now I do a

little bit more drama so I'm gonna go in

with my

kilowatt who loves us I mean isn't is

the best thing in the universe of makeup

like if you guys don't have this you

basically debt

another really flexible product like

this is one of my favorite things I

probably said that a few times already

but I mean it I mean it I mean it one of

them kilowatt because it's so fun it

they're designing duels and also sing go

the trophy wife was one of our top

sellers from the singles it's like sold

out everywhere it's hard to keep on the

shelves but the duels are so fun because

it depends on what mood you're in you

can even use it on the eyelid you can

use the sparkle on your cheek you can

use the flat one as a blush you can use

it I like to go all the way up to my

forehead sometimes I like to get

dramatic and go into my hairline so you

can go crazy with this thing and it will

never ever disappoint as we all know

when we do highlight we like to use

these little tedious brushes but I feel

like for everyday people sometimes that

can be scarier because they're just kind

of putting it wherever they feel like it

goes so Rihanna created this brush to

actually perfectly hug your cheek and

apply your highlight seamlessly every

time look at that you just said it

perfectly you don't have to do anything

the brush just works for you look at

that oh I just get I get lost in the

therapy of it all and I can actually

just use the same brush dip dip dip this

is me being in a real hurry and I don't

have time to put things down you just

need to do it okay ah it's so good and

then you can go back in and just make

this even brighter on the tip right

there look at that just for a little

more highlight on top of the highlight I

already applied look at it it's a dream

sorry I get so excited about my own

stuff but

it's not pretty turn to the audience

girl show them what you're working where

the chica can brush what I love about

everything at such as a convention has

it so like if we do it on the lids

awesome for example like look more

wiggle it okay you saw that from there

too right no because everything it

touches

it's the perfect brush look at that so

we're gonna go into some looks now we

have the fancy face perfected so what

kind of look are you gonna do you're

gonna use the Moroccan spice palette I

see you have that out jam okay so for me

I want to go more for a monochromatic

burgundy look I think not only does it

go with the season but it overall looks

beautiful with her skin tone in the

shape of her eyes let make a very nice

and soldiery the Moroccan spice palette

who's used this palette before it I

wanted to make a palette that was

something you can use for everyday and

then still had a few fun spiced up

colors that you can like go there and be

a little more dramatic with but this I

cannot leave my house and go on any trip

without this palette this probably

hasn't literally every base that I need

to start my look you can start any

makeup look from this you can do a easy

daytime natural casual look and you can

also just start a smoky eye with it

I've been to Morocco a few times and

actually the thing I really enjoyed the

most about it were the markets like I

loved walking around and being immersed

in the culture and seeing all the

different colors and textures and the

drums and I enjoyed it and so when I was

making this palette it came from that it

came from those experiences and I wanted

it to reflect the things that I remember

about that culture what about you

Priscilla what are you gonna do how much

is something fun something sultry you

know we're here in Dubai I want to do

something kind of dramatic so I'm gonna

go for like purpley pretty tones so I'm

going to take a little bit of spy

strip and I'm gonna use it as my middle

tone but I'm also gonna mix a little bit

of cumin get it just to make it like

that perfect middle tones whoo blend

your eyeshadow out with what are you

doing over here

Tennessee so what I like to do is shape

my smoky eyes first so I start with the

lower lash line and then I just fill in

the center I love Hennessy and I'm using

my whole over eyes shadow brush using

just the tip of the brush just wiggle it

back and forth a little lash lines

that's what I love about this brush you

can literally do it very tight or you

can just drop it and create a more drama

is this all Hennessy this is all

Hennessy let me show you what Hennessy

look like just so you know you go back

home that one eye I use that to do

eyeliner at the top when you wet it with

like a tiny little brush you could just

make that line really you can use it and

smoke it out make it dramatic you can do

the cut crease you can do underneath but

let's get into this brush though another

flexible tool as you see hecto use it to

go in underneath the eye this is also

all my favorite things to do use on the

lid it's just perfectly just right there

swipe one of the most important brushes

when it comes to eyeshadow you can also

bend with this brush as you can see that

the tip is still a little bit fuzzy so

there's a little bit of like you can go

in here in the crease and just get crazy

get precise I'm gonna finish off the eye

weights a little bit as kin a lot the

great thing about Rihanna's is she

created all products that you can use

everywhere which for me as a makeup

artist is essential you know I've always

kind of dug around my kid kind of had to

make seeing certain other things and put

them in different places but that's like

your philosophy and I've learned that

through you so I'm gonna do kilowatt on

the eyes that's kind of like the main

focal point I'm gonna take a little bit

of this beautiful color minted mojito

super gorgeous and I'm gonna wet my

brush just a little bit of water and I'm

gonna dip into here and I'm not playing

on the eyelids and it's just gonna give

this beautiful blue payoff so that's the

thing I love about Santa beauty is they

you don't ever have to be afraid you can

use things that make you feel artistic

and that inspire you and

for me that's one of the most essential

things when it comes to make up whatever

you Hector give us your final step right

so what I'm going to do here now is give

a little bit of texture to my look with

the one and only mr. trophy wife really

I think I just about you tell me where

you want me to put it I would put selfie

Y inner corner alright let's see look we

gotta be like really really go so it

pops against the smoke oh la la look at

that wait you're blocking it but and see

do the next movie alright let's finish

this off with a nice lip stunner force

than a week or my damn but the people

already know Donna it is what about you

Hector I think you just don't want to do

like a Sochi lab what do you think I was

thinking Griselda madam no go Griselda

or PMS not madam this is the end of the

first half of our artistry class and

beauty talk so I'm just gonna have you

guys check our girls out for just our

gorgeous and what about Rita oh you

given like smiles over here yes do you

see what makeup does to girl she does

not come in here like that she did not

walk in here like that all right ladies

and gentlemen have fun and I'll see you

guys in about 20 minutes

thank you

[Music]

did you miss me make some noise so these

ladies I've already been prepping

backstage with they're beginning stages

of the fancy face which is the

foundation and actually Hector has a fun

fact so what are my favorite things to

do personally is to do my complexion

with matchsticks

so he wanted to show you how beautiful

match six looks all over the face I did

foundation concealer and contour using

matchsticks there's nothing on her face

but matchsticks just so you know even

that nice bronze look over here on the

forehead all all matchsticks he hasn't

even put powder on her ass he's gonna do

that next

and Priscilla I'm gonna warm up the eyes

a little bit I'm gonna take matchsticks

and espresso as you can tell matchsticks

is like one of our favorite products

honestly as a makeup artist I feel like

I have just matchsticks I can literally

do a full face lip eyes cheek everywhere

and then how Hector did it on the skin

amazing so I'm actually gonna use this

as eyeshadow I'm gonna do her crease I'm

gonna use a little bit of espresso it's

just like that perfect contour shade

remember is very important to always

shape with something more neutral as is

your guide and then you add your color

one of the things that I've learned from

you that you always like like to apply

your contours first and then you add

color which i think is genius

so I'm gonna shape it with espresso you

start with the outer corner here first

to create this shape that I'm going for

if this allows you to also see the eye

shape cuz sometimes you think you know

and you're assessing but really until

you don't play your neutrals you don't

know how much you want to do so subtle

was so effective let's do a little fly

liner let's get into this line liner

have you guys tried it the little tip is

like super fine so you can do your thin

little line and then you can also do

more of a thicker line if you press a

little bit harder and it look how black

it

it's so dark and it stays black you know

you get like those eyeliners that dried

down and then the turn like this gray

Matt greenie kind of color drives me

crazy and so uh this was made with that

in mind you want to put on black

eyeliner he wanted to be black when you

wear it right let's go back to Hector

and see what he's up to

oh where did you do this with

matchsticks mash six as my shaper now

I'm just adding a little bit of saffron

saffron and then taking your spice

palette it's just really smoking this

house so this happened here

the only reason why I laughter that did

it on purpose you can see cuz not what

we want to do is just set that lid using

invisi mat as you know is one of those

things that naturally happens if you get

a crease and that's okay

you just wipe it off with a q-tip and

then just set that lid with a busy man

and he's doing it was saffron I just saw

him mix a little bit of this color into

priscila where we at Priscilla oh my god

a little bit of fun over here

are you putting gloss balm on our cheeks

sure I'm another secret that I learned

from you how many secrets have I learned

from Rihanna all right I learned more

from you I just don't I'm I've seen you

put it on your cheeks I've seen you put

it on your eyes it looks gorgeous

look at how the gloss mom just slides in

and it doesn't leave that line of like a

patch of grease you don't see her

fingerprints or anything on her face did

you take up the diamond balm yes right

here I was like it was right there and I

know it I I was having some okay but

just look at this formula guys oh it

like honestly it's like jelly but powder

at the same time it's so trippy just

feeling it is amazing but look at the

payoff on my hand

this is amazing I love you guys could we

like hang out everyday

you want to put some line about makeup

and stuff you want to put some on yeah

why not

so this is the kabuki brush right here

this is is designed to do very special

things I'm gonna start with her shoulder

look at that can you see that cameraman

are you getting that let's do the

collarbone as well because you know

these are the things men don't really

notice they just know something's

different

look at that like a dream like a dream

it looks like liquid do you see that it

looks wet it's not wet it really isn't I

can again I can do this a thousand times

in a circle until like my whole body

becomes this palette alright we're gonna

check in with Hector okay so one should

teach this beautiful artist how to

highlight the really way this palette

was created by the sunset my two

favorite colors together orange and pink

is really unexpected but they're

beautiful and it reminds me of like a

lot of stuff my mom used to have at home

but check this out he can do the pink as

a blush you can also use the orange as a

blush depending on your skin tone

depending on the look you're going for

if you just want a little bit of hint of

something but not too much the orange is

really subtle and really beautiful I

like using the orange on my eyes also

cuz kilowatt is just one of those

flexible products that you can use

anywhere and and do anything with

she asked me about eyelashes

there will be no stone left unturned

okay I am serious about my makeup okay I

want you to come into Sephora

stop at you fancy beauty counter and

leave okay that's what I want so don't

you worry so I think it's time for a lip

you know it's done a week we already

talked about that there's a brand new

Stunna

on the way and you know we are in Dubai

so I had to do something special and I

want to give it to you guys first you're

getting the first premiere of this

product I always say the best way to

show up to a party is uninvited and

that's what I call this shade it's black
