genifique is one of my favorite serums

i'm going to read some reviews

and see what other people have to say

one review says

it makes your skin feel super soft like

you have an invisible silk blanket on

top of your skin

that is a poetic way of putting it this

one says this product is absolutely

amazing it makes my skin feel so soft

plump even and hydrated and this is the

only one that actually improves the

quality of my skin

shout out to jacob from new jersey my

review would be

skin care daya one two three five out of

five stars

makes my skin feel super soft hydrated

exclamation point exclamation point

my skin my strength my genifique

and smiley face
