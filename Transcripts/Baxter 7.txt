my name is Neven Pontius and I live with

my wife scarlet my daughter Clementine I

grew up outside of Madison Wisconsin on

a farm run around with cows and mini

bikes oftentimes holidays meant going on

a road trip spending time with family in

Arizona we had an old Toyota van I think

we racked up like five hundred thousand

miles on it for us our family time is a

few hours in the morning doing little

activities like laying with play-doh and

tinkering on cars a little bit before I

head off to work part of the traditions

that we've held on to is going on a road

trip packing up the bags and getting in

the car and we go down spend time with

relatives and our parents and sometimes

grandparents I'm Steven Smith and I'm an

agrarian adventure travel and lifestyle

photographer I rent an apartment in Los

Angeles that's my home base but Colorado

still feels like home for the holidays

I'm heading back I ride from here to

Colorado because once you get into that

desert you're just humbled by that space

and then you can get up and start to see

the Rockies all the way up to the Front

Range and then I'm home knowing that no

matter how crazy year is and no matter

how much I'm traveling for work there's

always that kind of light at the end of

the year where just at least to take a

couple days to reflect eat well and just

be together and reconnect with the

family

I think the most beautiful days I've

seen in Malibu have been around the

olives I love it

my name is Davide I was born in Italy

three days after I've finished my

military service in Italy I went from

army barracks to Los Angeles Malibu was

pretty incredible my wife is from

California I had actually met her Europe

so when I got to that border I had an

old phone number and I called it so she

says I'll pick you up and she's like I

want to show you a place and we drove

down here and I think we spent you know

the whole day from that time on we have

been coming to this place this is a

place for for my wife and for our family

that is very special it's so important

for the kids it's nice to watch them get

so excited about the audience

approaching
