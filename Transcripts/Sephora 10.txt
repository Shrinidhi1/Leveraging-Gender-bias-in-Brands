the unique thing about me being a makeup

artist is the way that I actually apply

cosmetics so I have limited use of both

of my arms due to a physical disability

called arthrogryposis so I actually

taught myself how to apply cosmetics

using my mouth

[Music]

my name is Jesse and I'm a professional

makeup artist I am fully self-taught my

clients come from all walks of life and

a lot of people specifically come to me

just for the experience I've gotten so

many amazing reviews that it's almost

like a facial massage growing up with

Jesse in middle school I noticed she was

just a tomboy I was hanging around with

the guys just cool break and she come

back looking real pretty with the

mascara stuff I was I hold up I gotta

take another look at what's up and 69

extra to go to prom and then ever since

that we've been together for 15 years my

life is as normal as anybody else's we

get up drink coffee feed our animals our

fur babies love that have fun going out

places like everyone else

to the Sephora store I'd read it and I'm

happy at it cuz we get to try a lot of

different cool stuff but then the wallet

cries people they look at us with some

type of like repulsion they don't think

we can actually like being a

relationship together it'll be too hard

but we challenge that all the time he

gets me trust every single day he'll

help me put lashes on she loves me when

I do too but I love helping her and

doing everything and just it's my family

she's my wife

[Music]

I thought the industry would shun me you

know I was denied my education for

cosmetology one school that I went to

shredded my application in front of me

they told me that it was unsanitary and

that it was unethical that made me feel

like the gum on somebody's shoe

so I had my very first opportunity to do

makeup which was a fashion show and I

never told them how I applied cosmetics

and I was so scared

models were kind of you know standoffish

because it's that stereotype you know

she's gonna poke me in the eye oh you

know she's gonna drool on me and the

first model that sat in my chair she's

like I'm ready do you need me to help

you open anything she was just so

welcoming that was the fuel that I

needed the second day I had 23 models

lined up wanting to experience this and

wanting to go onto the runway with

makeup that I put on

there were so many people that told me I

would never be where I am and thinking

back to where I started and where I came

from it was all worth
