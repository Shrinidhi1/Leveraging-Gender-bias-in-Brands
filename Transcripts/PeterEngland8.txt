I think it's a huge honor PETA England

is a brand I don't have very few brands

India that you actually grow up looking

at as as describing words like honesty

and confidence and and and always good

intent and I think a lot of us not just

in my generation but even in the current

younger generation kind of subscribe to

the fact that PETA England attributes

itself to to confidence and and doing

things right and and succeeding in life

and I've been a patron high speed ending

as a brand I was younger I still do and

so it's a great honor to be a part of

this kind of a relationship and as an

actor it's always interesting when a

brand see synergy in you and the fact

that you along with the brand can take

it to another place I always believe

it's it's a two-way process that

whatever I contribute to Pitt England is

a brand be genuine contribute to that as

a brand as well so I think it's it's a

fantastic synergy that I'm really

looking forward like I said as far as

speed England's attributes they're quite

evident from what they do and the kind

of shirts and the kind of clothes that

they make they stand for confidence they

stand for for youngsters believing in

themselves and going out and achieving

what they dream of my films that I do

I've always thought that I've strived to

make films that are clean films that are

honest and try to reach an audience and

emotionally reach out to them on on

terms of honesty and good intent so I

think the synergy works on that sense my

fan base in the South where I come from

as well as in Hindi based on the films

I've done here is predominantly young

and it's always interesting to take a

stand-up brand like Peter England and

take it to a younger audience and so I

think that's an interesting synergy at

the same time it also helps that I come

from an educated background I am an MBA

by education and I think the thing it

also stands for for values of of knowing

what you are talking about and saying it

clearly so it's about speaking out and

speaking out clearly and I think that's

a good synergy as well to tell you a

little secret I've always enjoyed

wearing formal clothes ever since I was

a kid in school even if there wasn't an

occasion that deserved it I always went

out to buy a nice shirt and trousers and

a belt because believe it or not I've

always wanted to be older and I looked

at formal clothing as an extension of

that that desire so when I got older I

kind of enjoyed the fact that I didn't

need an excuse anymore I could look

mature without you know having too

reason for it but I don't eclis as I got

older people claimed I still look

younger than my age and didn't take me

seriously enough so I think a style

quotient for people like me who don't

get taken seriously too often is to is

to use formal clothing like this to be

taken seriously and and kind of sound

mature and look mature so I that but on

a serious note I have a very specific

style quotient which is it's it's it's a

quotient of comfort because if I'm not

comfortable what I'm wearing it's going

to show on my face and it doesn't matter

how expensive it is or who'd recommended

it to you it it's not going to be

stylish so for me clothes have to come

from within and and the reason I like

pretending is a brand also is that I

feel very comfortable saying the word

Spieth England and wearing their clothes

and it's that's a really important thing

to say

I should be comfortable saying I'm

wearing Peter England I think I look

stylish in it so I think that kind of

style comes true it's not really advice

I I can only tell you what I practiced

and I still think I'm young at heart and

quite young as well so for me it's about

believing in yourself

and knowing who you are it's it's very

important to like I mean I wouldn't want

you to just wear Pete England because so

that said bye Pete England

look it's you that wearing pretty

Englund if you think you've got the same

kind of confidence and attitude that he

has please go out there and put on

wedding in short and it will become your

own attitude it's about not having

somebody else's view of somebody else's

values but kind of making your values

come out with your clothing and your

style and I think pitting is the right

way to go I don't experiment too much

with my clothes I'm old-fashioned in

that sense I like simple shirts and

matching trousers so I'm not a back he

dresses it some might be in in the

current context of today's youth but I

say go with whatever you're comfortable

with I'd say a nice pair of shoes and a

good belt goes a long way and telling

somebody to see this dresser because

it's not just about concentrating on the

on the shortened trousers you also have

to look at the access the reason and men

only have these two to go with apart

from the watch obviously but we don't

have the the other advance the kind of

other assets that women can use in terms

of accessorizing

so I'd say a good pair of shoes and a

good belt apart from a crisp formal

shirt it goes along like I said it's an

absolute joy to be associated with this

brand it's a brand that that demands

respect not just from my father or me

but even from kids younger than me as

well and like it says on the board that

it's the beginning of good things I hope

that applies to both meeting and and for

me

and this relationship goes on to two

very fruitful conclusions and goes on

for a long time so looking forward to

that

Peter England the beginning of good

things
