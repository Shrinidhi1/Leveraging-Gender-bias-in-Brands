hey beauties Lancome summer collection

is here and I'm so excited to play with

some color this vibrant blue smokey eye

is very wearable and not overly dramatic

but fierce enough for a night out

as always I'm starting with primer la

bas acuatic will help your eyeshadow

stay on longer and brighter throughout

the night

now dip your fluffy brush into this nude

shadow and apply a soft wash of color to

the area between your brow and lash line

you can't really see this nude shade on

my skintone but you'll feel it once you

start blending in other colors pick up

the chocolate brown shade and begin to

trace out your natural fold I'm using

brush number 16 which is a fine edge

defining brush add a bit more to the

crease and don't worry about being

precise at this point as long as the

general shape is there next winged out

the crease connect and darken the outer

corner now pick up more of that nude

shadow and use a stiff number thirteen

brush to diffuse and soften the brown

shadow a stiff brush will help you erase

some of the harsh edges and in turn will

create more of a smoky look for my lid

color I'm applying a thin layer of this

bright blue ombre Hypnose stylo and I'm

adding it to the lower lash line as well

this step is optional but it will make

your eyeshadow practically bullet proof

waterproof for sure pick up the darkest

blue shadow with number eleven brush and

apply it over the ombre Hypnose stylo

sealing the lid color by patting it on

look how bright and pigmented that is

this color is everything use the edge of

the brush to add it to the lower lash

line as well now go back with that

pointed number sixteen brush that you

used to apply the chocolate brown and

blend the edges where the blue meets the

brown you don't need to add more shadow

just use whatever is left on your brush

dip a flat number eighteen brush into

the lightest blue shade and use it to

highlight the inner corner then dip the

same brush into the medium blue shade

and add it to the transition between the

two blues to create a soft gradient

effect and don't forget the lower lash

line now I'm using black fishness gel

liner my absolute fave to define my lash

lines and complete this eye look

I'm adding it to the top lashline wing

optional and both water lines tight

lining the top for an extra smoldering

look as a final step I'm defining my

lashes with definicils mascara which is

another fave and on my lips I'm wearing

this coral Alizee juicytube

it feels so good to wear some color

after a long winter and now I want to

see you try it

thanks for watching until next time
