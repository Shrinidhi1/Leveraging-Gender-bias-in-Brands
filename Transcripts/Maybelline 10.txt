hey guys it's me nikkietutorials and

over here we have nebula and we are

doing a back to school makeup like this

I love to color correct I don't care if

I have 5 minutes 2 minutes 1 minute 30

seconds I'm going to color correct so

I'm going to show you how I quickly do

not repine Baby Lips today a baby winged

today honestly and I'm using a gel

pencil eyeliner but I'm grabbing a

little brush so I have more precision

and I can actually create a way so I

always do this because these are the

spots for I find that I have some

hyperpigmentation some and some darkness

but if you have dark circles or acne

scars find the master camera pen that

works for you I'm on your skin tone and

I promise you the results are so

beautiful and I love them so much I'm

going to be using my maybelline

superstay foundation and this is in the

shade golden I love this beauty sponge

okay I'm telling you like I can just

pounce pounce pounce pounce pounce and

be out the door and this foundation is

super full coverage super long wearing

so if you have a lot of stuff to do

after school this is your foundation

okay

I'm just applying a little tiny hair of

a lighter

and that's just gonna give me that

really nice like without the later can

you teach me how to do that sound I

would I'm gonna curl my lashes and then

apply a waterproof mascara this is the

trick because if you have straight short

lashes like I do you need a waterproof

mascara to hold the curl get the

centerpoint girl thank you

the only point I'm getting in school

another little trick I have is grabbing

your mascara and using it as an inner

corner eyeliner because it will stay how

longer I'm using the Maybelline fit me

concealer and this is in the shade sand

this might seem a little light but I

like really bright center points of my

face and then I use bronzer to really

warm my face up next up is my master

contour kit and I'm gonna use this to

bronze my face as well as on my lids

because this is this one kit will do

your whole face and I love the contour

in this kit because it warms up my face

so much and it also looks so great on my

lids well I'm actually just taking some

of the contour and applying it on my

lids the blush I'm using today is coral

I just think you look sweeter with some

blush mm-hmm

alright little trick for a dewy

highlighter at school you grab your Baby

Lips and you're gonna mix it with your

highlighter today I'm using the master

chrome mix these two together on the

back of your hand tap it on to the

highest points of your cheek wait I'm

crying at how good you look now I'm

going to using everyone's best friend my

first best friend it was my first two

Great Lash everybody loves Great Lash I

love Great Lash so I'm gonna go ahead

and apply this on my lashes

[Music]

today going in with another baby lips

for the actual lips not on the skin this

is the baby lip sync glow balm and this

just put it on and see the magic happen

it reacts to the pH levels of your skin

I love how this looks and it grabs all

of your lower lashes to it which I love

so much

see how pink it good oh wow

love now I'm using at my master chrome

highlighter in molten gold and I'm just

going to apply this this is the best

highlighter I mean say no more like it

looks so hot Wow oh I love this is all

Christ

oh she's glowing Nym glowing I'm coming

to school to glow but now it's time for

lips to really seal the deal exactly and

super stay matte ink so long-lasting

it'll stay on through everything okay 70

which is Amazonian is one of my

favorites see this color is so pretty

the weight of this applicator is shaped

you can really just create that perfect

shape

oh my gosh it looks so good the biggest

secret to a long-lasting makeup you
