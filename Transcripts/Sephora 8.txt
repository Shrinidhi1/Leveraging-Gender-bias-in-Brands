i'm bailey and i'm six i'm chloe and i'm

ted during christmas i had one last gift

to get for the girls and so i thought

makeup would be fun of course they was

excited about it and braley she just

said well daddy can i put makeup on you

my dad has a good face for me

i'm brad i'm chloe and braylee's dad and

some people know me as makeup dad

i'm a supervisor for a trucking company

so i have to turn it on i have to be

manly man you know at work but once i

clock out and i get around my girls my

daughter's got me wrapped around their

finger you know and but i wouldn't have

it no other way

chloe's real chill i mean she's real

cool calm and collected braylee is the

happy-go-lucky one she's always smiling

she got this little giggly laugh that

you know people just fall in love with

and they both love makeup we went into

sephora they loved the lip gloss all the

makeup palettes and talking to like the

workers they were really pretty and

they're really nice

yeah the employees that so far were

great one was showing braley you know

how to apply the blush and where to put

the blush on your cheek not only not on

my forehead

chloe is actually

really really good i'd say bray is like

a abstract artist though

when i posted the picture on social

media you know i was just having fun it

was more like

i can't believe i did

he wouldn't this because he is kind of

the best at ever

you know i was okay with it but when it

got to

five thousand ten thousand and six

hundred thousand i couldn't you know i

couldn't believe it

i started to see a lot of other men say

hey you know i did this with my daughter

but

what i was more touched by is when i was

getting dms from women

and their dad may have passed away and

they said you know i brought them

memories of their dad

um

and it just made their day

and and the time that it happened you

know i felt like we was in

it's crazy time with the world shut down

and everything going on but i got the

jokes and i'm okay with i got tough skin

i'm not worried about that but

it touched people

made them

remember their dad or you know the time

that you know they did this with their

dad or wish their dad was around still

to be able to do that with them

beauty comes in all shapes and all sizes

all colors

all everything so you don't have to just

be in this box

to be considered beautiful

so i want the girls to know that they

don't have to be in a box you know

anything that they they want to do you

know they can create their own beauty

okay
