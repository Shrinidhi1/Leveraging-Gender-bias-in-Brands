we see it happen

everywhere at any time 78 of women have

experienced sexual harassment in public

spaces

like a suggestive comment a sexually

explicit touch

an inappropriate gesture

or being followed and it threatens our

self-worth

it takes over who we are we see it

happen

but stay cautiously silent and

uncomfortably look away

maybe because we don't know what to do

how to help

or how to combat the situation

the time has come to keep our heads up

and to stand up for each other

against street harassment and everyone

can be part of the solution

harassment in public spaces
