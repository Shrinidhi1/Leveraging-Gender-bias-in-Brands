hi I'm Cynthia dimeo Global stylist at

rare Beauty and I'm so excited to share

our newest product you all know I'm a

huge fan of the soft pinch liquid blush

but we've heard your feedback that the

blush runs out way too quickly and that

you have to keep going back to Sephora

over and over again to buy more this is

why we created our best selling

award-winning liquid blush in a new

exclusive jumbo size it's the same great

formula you know and love but now you'll

finally have enough to get a soft plush

of color and you won't have to go buy a

new one every week our soft pinch liquid

blush is long wearing and highly

pigmented one dot is all you need see

how a little goes a long way it layers

beautifully without disturbing your

makeup featuring the world's first

custom Joe food applicator that's the

size of literal doe foot the beautiful

bottle design will look great on your

vanity we're also launching a new

subscribe and save plan so you can

automatically get a new jumbo sized

blush sent to you every 10 years so

you'll never run out
