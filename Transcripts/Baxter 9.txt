What do I love about LA? The culture.

It's like everyone's kind of united—everyone coexists with each other.

LA is more kicked back—there's no pressure, you know?

You just live, you know? Day by day, you're chill.

Have positive energy, do good to people— hopefully it'll come back

But don't depend on it
