we are very different and we're both men

but his idea of being a man is this sony

so what

[Music]

so it's kind of like a slab to the

society

but what about

you know the head of their

idea of beauty the society

like this

[Music]

hello everyone this is ankus bhagna and

you have tuned into yet another episode

of the gentleman show by the man company

aspect discussion

acceptance of people who we may not

necessarily

the conversation has changed and we need

to keep up with it and you know the

owners of learning is on all of us right

we have natasha who is india's first

trans woman to win a beauty pageant

and we have arnab viswas who identifies

as a gay man and also works on diversity

and inclusion at his workplace hello

both of you how are you

how are you i'm good i'm good

i am good i'm good i'm just thinking

conversation body intention

and i'm just

and i just want to say start this by

saying that if i mess it up if i mess

something up if i say something wrong if

i use the wrong terms please feel free

to correct me because i feel um it's

just very

important to uh give out the right

information and opinions about this

particular topic and um to all my

listeners i want to say i know your

topic to maybe what heavy

but

i feel that it's high time that we talk

about these things quite openly and um

i'm pretty sure that everything that is

said on today's podcast is going to be a

learning for someone or the other yep

okay so i'm going to start with you know

full form with the lgbtqia plus

which is like a blanket term for a whole

community which is like a wide spectrum

of gender and identities and sexuality

and whatnot so lgbtqia plus stands for

lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer

intersex and ally and there's a plus

because

i think the plus is there because um

you know

till date we have come so far with so

many genders at the moment and the

different um

virtues of being born in this world

right so i think it's going to be more

than plus so i think what's your

pleasure would

it's more about you know you we want to

cover everyone because there might be

people who do not identify as

one of them and any of these

existence is still valid of course so

that's the reason and we are unaware

about it so that's the reason we you

know want to cover everyone and be more

inclusive and that's the plus

basic questions

because i feel that

we get

like they've heard transgender but they

don't know what cisgender is yeah so up

uh can one of you or both of you define

for me

cisgender transgender

what is intersex what is cross-dressing

let's just you know clear them first

before answering this question it's very

important to know that what is sex at

birth

what is gender and what is sexual

orientation so let's start with that sex

or gender make africa sex i mean sex is

good and gender

wow okay

gender is uh you know i am born uh i'm

assigned male at birth but then i don't

think from my heart and mind that i'm a

i'm a guy okay so then i am identify i

identify myself as a as a as something

different than my assigned than my uh

sex at birth

someone is born male assigned male 1

i'll tell you my example i'm i'm born

with sex at my sex at birth is male so

is mine yeah yeah i i identify from my

mind and heart as a male so i'm a

cisgendered man

okay so i am also cisgendered man so if

you if you were born to all my listeners

i'm just explaining if you are

assigned

male at birth and you also identify as a

man then you're cisgender yours is

gendered and now sexual orientation is a

very different thing now as a man i am

attracted towards another man

then it's i'm gay and that's got nothing

to do with your gender that's not got

nothing to do with this other two you

know uh fields which i've explained so

but you know i would not say that i'm

100 correct because it's a very very

difficult and complicated topic so i

think there are always difference in

opinions and we are we should be able to

accept those opinions i'm saying that

gay people

can also be cisgender

yep i'm a cisgendered gay man right

understood okay and natasha tell us

about

the difference between like

transgenders and cisgenders

so like what happened was um when i was

born so i was assigned male and birth

but um as with time i grew i decided

that um i wasn't i was not in the right

body so i want to change i want to

change my

you know what i was assigned at birth i

wanted to be a female i want to be a

woman so i underwent transition and i

underwent my surgeries and everything to

be called as a woman at this point of

time so what happens over here is that

um

i've transitioned to be a woman and when

i talk about the cisgender women is

someone who is assigned female at birth

or women at birth so that is exactly the

difference over here

so in in simpler terms like uh

transgender people are people who are

assigned one thing at birth right but

they identify something

gender right the one they have so then

do they have to undergo surgery to be

trans

not necessarily i think it's a very

great question because um you know bob

to my belief that i wanted it so it's my

free will to do it so someone there like

there might be a lot of other twins

women who do not want to do it so it's i

think it's a free will also

accessibility

definitely

yeah it is expensive right i wish it's

covered by the government someday

whenever actually

questions so cross-dresser or

transgender mecha

so you know let me put it like this when

i started my transition

that was back in 2015 long time ago so

what happens over there is there was a

phase in my life where i went to my

psychologist i went to my psychiatrist

because it was necessary to have these

two people the signing before my

surgeries happen because they undergo

rigorous um evaluation to understand

what they are they really wanting to

be of the opposite gender right so

whatever what happens over here is um i

had to cross this for a while to

understand how it feels to wear a bra

how it feels to wear a panty i'm just

going a little bit more inner so people

understand how does it feel when i wear

a dress so over here

i feel good so that is exactly i was

given that green signal that yes you can

go ahead and have your surgery right so

when it comes to cross-dresser a person

doesn't necessarily have to

have i mean have a surgery undergone

why because you know the person is happy

as what the expression they are showing

so again over here then comes the

non-binary

there's a lot of it's like a chain

enough like incan link we've talked

about men we've talked about women we've

talked about trans people there is like

there are non-binary people there are

gender fluid people also right joe who

don't so can you explain what gender

fluid people and non-binary

so people believe see

we have always lived in a world where

everything is defined by binary a male

and a female and one yeah so those are

the two digits right so it is high time

we understand that there can be

different uh you know kinds of people

within that spectrum of zero and one

some defined some undefined some yet to

be defined

and that's where non-binary comes

non-binary means it's a non-zero or a

non-one it can be 0.1 it can be 0.4 so

how much you know towards male or

towards female you know those two

binaries i feel like so they don't

necessarily identify as either basis

either way then also i know one

particular one but suppose i'm dressed i

feel like a man today it might happen

that tomorrow i feel like a woman so i

don't define it you know

regularly but then that's how i feel i

can't help it so those are non-binaries

okay and it's

it is none of your business what another

person identifies

one point i always make angus is that uh

whenever you are you know trying to

break out of the rule you become an

exception and an exception always stands

out

so no one wants to be an exception in a

given point of time if someone is trying

hard to become an exception out of uh

the in spite of facing all the ridicule

and you know the hap you know all the

fun being made at that means just

imagine how strongly that person

believes that this is what i want

exactly

i think that's where you know i can i

should put a word here because um

how badly i needed that right and how

badly i needed that body because

the feeling is euphoria when you have

undergone your

journey i would say and

i mean i would love to share it here

when i saw my body first time in the

mirror

without i think skin is the best cloth

in on our bodies so

it feels euphoria

and that is exactly he just put it in

his voice

but okay so natasha i want to talk to

you about this whole journey and if you

don't mind sharing with us because i

feel that

it may inspire people listening to this

it may also

make more people understand what it is

really like to be trans and growing up

trans right right because i'm pretty

sure that

things were difficult before you

realized you know what being trans is so

can we start from the beginning can you

tell us about your story so like um like

i come from calcutta i was in a all boys

school in synthesis calcutta so

of course bullying has been a part of my

life

since um i was little feminine when i

was a boy when i was a young boy so

it's like

you know like those visions coming right

now so it's like um you know fighting

yourself every day when you go to school

and you get to meet your class friends

and

i remember staying alone from the rest

of the boys because i would just not go

out and play football cricket on all the

physical activities that guys would tend

to do during that time remember i'm

talking about 2015 now long time back so

then what happens over here is um

so like growing in that atmosphere

being called names and you know certain

way to behave then you go back home then

i think my only friends were my servants

in the house when i was young right so

since my father's father was an ice

officer i was staying in a huge house

and everything so i couldn't gel

with my other neighbors but the boys

were there so

it was tough but did you always know

that you're trans or it took a while a

woman i would say i always knew i was a

woman okay so deep down within me so i

think that is exactly i

knew from then

at what age what age was this i um

i remember going through a lot of

journeys that time when the first

internet dropped in into calcutta so my

father got the internet so we had

computer classes

and my elder brother who was in the same

school so he told him that you know i

think this is what i represent i feel

like i remember my brother giving me a

porn cd in class sevens class ten or

nine i might be wrong he said you should

see the chemistry between a male and a

female

that time and i was like okay i'm the

female right he literally switched it on

and said i'm going to go to the other

room and see what happens so maybe this

is a phase he told me it's a phase in

your life that eventually like the women

body i said no i don't want to you're

just forcing me to

do something that i don't want to right

and that's wrong and at that time to

reach i knew that so i think it was in

class seven when i started this

but did you know when people react like

that did it make you question yourself

did it make you

feel like

there's something not uh you know you're

different from other people well

definitely you know imagine um when a

child goes to school

and uh you've been boycotted not been

spoken to because of your behavior

called names like and everything

i think that breaks the spirit of the

child it breathes because the child

doesn't know right until you tell them

so it made me believe that i'm different

which i was not

you know so it made me believe that okay

i'm different because this is how the

world thinks about me so yeah that i

think it was tough

i would definitely say it was tough

enough is in

very deep thought right now do you

yeah are you thinking about your

experiences yeah because she's talking

about 2015 i came way back because i'm

much older to other people so over here

so

when i came out i mean i would if i talk

about my journey i think uh

my father expired when i was a little

kid and i was born and brought up you

know i was brought up by my sister and

my mother it was always the female

members who was surrounding me

so

many times uh it has been told that you

are gay because you were always

surrounded by women and as you mentioned

i've also heard

you know if you have a lot of female

energy around you so you know so it it

makes me

question their education because if a

girl is being surrounded by a lot of men

would he become a boy so that's my i

mean you know you know what i mean i

mean so you can't become yeah you can't

become this is not something which i

have chosen this is what i am

so and uh as she mentioned that i was

also not much interested in sports while

my cousins and all my friends were busy

you know playing table tennis and

football and cricket i was i was very

happy and comfortable with playing with

dolls but then

their rules were my i come from a very

orthodox bengali family so they're like

oh oh why is he not playing qriket he

should be you know he should be

going there learn character and all that

but slowly and steadily i realized you

know that uh i am different and i'm okay

with my difference

so when you are confident about yourself

when you self-accept yourself then what

the third person is thinking about me

doesn't make any difference so that gave

me a lot of confidence and also

my first boyfriend whom i met in college

that person made me realize that i'm not

the only one because i didn't have

internet access then

so when i saw that okay there can be

people like me i was already

self-accepted myself then i saw a third

person and you were like okay you're

huge was i'm like like both of you said

you talked about being effeminate as a

child right so did uh arnab and that's

that was your journey to realizing that

you're gay but there may be so many gay

people who may not be effeminate as kids

right

for sure i mean

this is not a formula there's no see

over the years we have uh we have marked

that okay pink is for women blue is for

men we have gender we have given gender

to everything possible

we have given characteristics to

everything so these are all social

constructs

i was asking my sister she has equal

potential like me that why have you

never you know

done something else why have you always

been a school teacher because she's like

you know we have been blown up in a way

brought up in a way that no longer

school teachers

scope

a few professions that were accepted

yeah so which is ridiculous but then

yeah right

so coming back to you

then

where did you go from there when you

realized that okay you're a woman

but did the world around you believe

that just because you believe that

well um i remember coming out to my

elder brother first and um

i would just not come out to my brother

to my father because he was very strict

sorry one second i want to cut you there

and ask you one more question did you

have any

did you know of any um people from the

community at that age or did you have

any role models in your family or

someone who trained i mean not from

their family but then uh as i said in

class seven when i had access to

internet i started googling uh different

transgender people and the first one

came was miriam rivera so i think she

was killed or something later on i got

to know but then a lot of other girls

like um there's news that i would like

to say that uh carolyn cossey was one of

the first transgender james bond girl in

back in 90s so a lot of people doesn't

even know about it

right so i started following these

people's journey read about them i can't

imagine having nobody

to talk to about this when you're

realizing such a big truth about

yourself oh yes and depending on just

the internet all by yourself that must

have been

yeah so like you know like of course my

internet one my computer was my friend

so i used to come and um

understand and you know try to get

things out you know in my mind and

everything so i used to like you know

process it in my head

and then finally tell my brother in

class 8 i remember and

one find i just say the spawn series of

no use because you know you're just

trying to put me in a box which i don't

want to and then um

so i knew like my father would be

totally against it since um i like our

numbers you know he lost his father i

lost my mother when i was in class six

so you know like um so i was in a very

strict vigilance by my father as a mom

and a dad both

so then i was was he supportive of this

he i mean eventually i would say he was

but initially no because he would just

scare me that you cannot do this and all

um it was totally against it

but i found my way to leave the city and

come and start it you left the city yeah

i left after my schooling

because i in class 12 i had to finish

three years since he was for 12 years

and

my father was you're going to davis

college and i'm like no i'm not going

because i have to stay back back in

calcutta under his vigilance

so

i had to just leave right so i started

applying for fashion colleges and he

made me sit for

clart exam eyes exam because he's a nice

person he's like you have to sit for all

these exams and i did sit for them and

um i just tick mark whatever i wanted

because i didn't want it to pass

was switching cities was this one reason

that you could not live your life

definitely yes my relatives were not

that friendly as well because they also

had been not great towards my family so

my father had to see a lot because of my

behavior like imagine in back in

calcutta we have this ritual um i'm sure

that you know when we have saraswati

puja we all cousins come together and

then we're having durga puja in my house

from 10 15 years by then

and my cousins would not be like that

friendly with me

so i would be like oh my god like it's

so bad right

it must have been very very hard yeah

even for you ernab like growing up

because

i'm guessing now your mother is very

supportive of it but i mean

right now everyone in the family is very

supportive including my cousins uh

probably ankush i would say uh because

it was way long back

i uh i generally don't blame them

because they were not aware

but because they were not aware i

i can't really say that i was not

tormented i was tormented because i the

problems that she just mentioned i have

faced similar problems and similar

issues in my life that you know uh why

are you dressing up like a girl why do

you want to wear a bindi

and at that point when i was in class

two and three i didn't know that okay

i'm not supposed to do it

i remember days where i was crying alone

and i could not even explain it to my

mother that you know why i was crying

because

i would be very ashamed i remember one

instance in my school i was in class

eight

my biology teacher asked me what is your

gender

she was making fun of me in front of the

entire teacher a teacher a biology

teacher

had it been possible i would have told

her name as well but then

because i named those evils yeah but

yeah yeah

but that incident was so scary for me

with 66 other because i remember there

were 67

students in the class

and others all other 66 people laughing

at must have been humiliating it was

very humiliating i don't remember what i

have done to

ask me that question and i might my

question right now would have been how

dare you and it was obviously done to

shame you and not to shame me it was not

a genuine question and

you won't believe me she was one of

those teachers in school whom everyone

would look up to she was dressed up very

smartly and you know she was one of

those fancy teachers i would say and she

asked me this question but till date

that incident is there in my fresh in my

mind yeah do you ever get like for

example i was also bullied as a child

and i feel that now i have overcome all

of that but one mention of these

incidents and they're very fresh in my

memory yeah so is it the same i'm sure

it was well um since our numbers

mentioned biology teacher i mean let's

not name these evil spirits you know

first of all so good for them actually

right now

right now yeah so you know what happened

over here was uh i had a teacher who

would imitate me in front of my 50 other

art students

so when that time i was in class 10

my icsc was on the way so

i remembered i think it was a maths

class or

yeah it was let's um let's not get into

too much of details as well so the

teacher comes and i mean i as a normal

student i would just say that i had a

question for

a certain number you know for like for a

certain subject right the syllabus so

then uh like he would imitate me

so you know i mean that's like and the

entire class would laugh

imagine teachers doing this they're

supposed to teach you and they're

supposed to be good role models

wow so the enter class would laugh and

you imagine that the teacher is there

for 40 45 minutes and teaching and he's

gone so what i'm going through the rest

of the day from 9 a.m to 3 p.m so you

know they would just um

you know they would do the same thing

because you know teachers are supposed

to be teaching students so if you're

teaching this to bully others you're

adding on fool to fire so that is

exactly

transphobia homophobia it's not deep

probably those teachers didn't realize

what they were doing no probably that

same teacher would behave completely

differently right now because i'm sure

she's a well-read woman and she wouldn't

evolved she has evolved so in my case i

most of the times you know uh pardon a

lot of people thinking that okay it was

way too back but that teacher i could

not pardon honestly

for example

now your parents are supportive are your

parents supportive yeah i think the

tables turned for me after i uh when my

father saw the first article in calcutta

news that i was the first kolkata trans

woman to win a beauty pageant so that is

where my turning point happened

so my father would um i remember not

speaking to him for quite a long time

because for him it was very hard to

understand that

um you know his son is a she now right

so

he tried all his best so

when you transitioned do you remember

the day when after the transition you

met your parents oh yes yes so i think

um the best part of my life was when um

when i won the pageant in 2017 and once

again for all the listeners transition

meaning that you underwent a surgery

surgery to call myself a woman okay i'm

just like like a physical surgery a

physical cemetery okay so you know buzz

what happened was when i went back to

calcutta so what happened was um

i met him right my father so for the

first time in human flesh he saw me like

that and

i met all his um

his colleagues

and the most shocking people

yes i met all his colleagues and they

kind of you know like inaugurated me

with the flowers because i made my

father proud right and there were other

ice officers high police officers and

everything and out of which one i used

to call g2 when i was young like g2 uh

in bengali we say that so

he comes and he was crying okay i think

he was not drunk then so you know he was

not drunken

he was he was crying and holding my hand

and his wife was there auntie was there

so it was only my hand i said uncle why

are you crying and then

he says then you know what natasha when

i was young

you can imagine when i was young he's

like plus 60 right

i kind of um

wore my mom's

my sister's frock

and my father would come and beat me up

beat my out of me that evening

right so

seeing you i realized that

what you have changed in our minds

so i think that gave me a lot of courage

and that's impact that's a huge impact

and i was i had to use in my eyes and i

was i'm getting goosebumps right now

because i think that incident was very

touchy in my in my mind that time i just

want to say i'm very very proud of you

yeah thank you honor i think one small

uh you know point which i want to make

crying

do you not think that sometimes i'm not

defending people but i'm just saying

sometimes sympathizing may be a way of

them showing support or is that not how

you're supposed to i think you should

show support we are talking about

equality no one wants normalizing and

normalizing the more you will sympathize

the bigger the problem becomes because

it's always you're always looked in a

different

look with a different special place

are you saying that if you tell someone

that if you come out to someone or if

you tell them your story

what is an appropriate response is there

any i mean i mean

depends also uh generally i would not

tell my story to everyone for i can give

you a small incident which happened

yesterday after podcast

i mean but then uh

i came out to a colleague like very very

uh you know

normally without any without much hustle

and but he didn't react and that's

exactly the reaction we want he didn't

react he didn't say anything but i was

thinking

you're so used to being giving you

some big thing has happened oh my god

it's fine to just have uh being gay is

okay

it's you know that you know so i was

talking to this uh trans person once and

she told me that

according to her it's very personal

that's what she said she said it's very

personal but i like the reactions where

there is no reaction

because that's the only time where i

feel like what i look like what my

identity is not a point of conversation

i tell people something they they're

like okay cool

and yeah that's normal that's

normalizing it in the real estate

absolutely according to her the younger

generation

they don't they care i mean most of them

the the i would i would actually not say

the younger generation in in total

because obviously we're talking about us

we are talking about a certain section

of the society

educated aware of you know social media

exposure exposure lives in metro cities

those those handful of people they don't

react

but is this the same uh you know

condition all over india all over rural

india i'm not sure i'm not sure of

course

i get on uh you know social media every

day

by putting up very simple stuff people

you know come back saying that you know

you are great you are a hero i said i

don't think i have done something

supernatural but those things trigger

you know those things make a huge impact

in their life but imagine

when like it's so interesting that you

said

supernatural thought but interesting you

embracing yourself

is seen as an act of heroism because

that's the right that's where we are

right i'm just being me

and that is supposed to be a statement

in itself because most people are not

allowed to be there right right

like

as much as i'm proud of you i also feel

um

people are not allowed to be themselves

yeah i mean many people call me

privileged for that i think we are

privileged but

how we best utilize that privilege is

also something in our hand i mean i can

give you a small example which one

activity we did in our office so just to

give context arnab uh

just company manufacture he uh does a

lot of work for the community yeah yeah

what do you do about total background so

i work in finance but then i also uh you

know lead the lgbti wing in my company

so

that way uh we have done a lot for

social inclusion of uh the community uh

but then in as a part of the activities

on push i would just uh just tell you a

small example uh we asked people to wear

nail polish on their you know one of the

fingers and ask them to hide throughout

the day

most of ninety percent of the people

came back with a horrified experience

that i can't hide my finger

imagine a gay person hiding his own self

throughout her or his life how difficult

it can be

you can't hide one finger i'm hiding

myself all over you know every every

time i come out

wow

i think they'll understand how it how

does it feel it's a great maybe a

fraction maybe a fraction i mean just

paint one of the fingers and then i ask

you to hide don't show this finger to

anyone throughout the day come back to

me and tell me how you feel tomorrow

running into their running into your own

shoes i really hope all the listeners

listening to this right now

well i think um

definitely yes thinking

it's a mixed feeling why because um i

think of course

little bit change has been

visible but then we are not 100 yet

could we have had this conversation if

it was not decriminalized

[Music]

you could not even openly i think see

being gay was never uh

was never a criminal act uh i mean

having uh being caught in a being caught

in a sexual position with a person of

same i mean same uh you know orientation

or same gender i mean not the right term

same sex same sex that was uh not legal

okay but then again we had other laws

joe

those were very complicated natasha what

do you have to say about this i think

have you decided yes or no of course i

mean little as i said i think i

mentioned you like little change has

been there but uh our number is right as

well like you know by education is

something that should reach each part of

this land so everybody understands and

what it is and without knowing how will

you know who is gay who is trans person

like you know till date i would say that

uh in 2022 if i go

uh to a village and someone will not be

if i tell or someone gets to know i'm a

trans woman i think there'll be

reactions still because education has

not reached in that land on that part of

india legally problem near

socially yes i think society society

wise there's a lot to do

we have not even near the ten

legally problems

because uh yeah

section 37 decriminalizes homosexuality

but it has not given us equal rights we

can't marry we can't uh have inheritance

of property uh we can't divorce we can't

do a lot of stuff inheritance is

property in returns a property from i

mean if i have a partner there is no

inheritance of property of by the

partner

how it is in the cisgender yeah partners

so there are multiple issues still there

so i mean whether i want to get married

or not that's a personal question

probably i don't option though but i

have to i should have the option of

saying yes or no

so i'm not very sure so i would not

comment about surrogacy and adoption so

i think there are problems there as well

so legally are we there we are not there

um

i want to ask you this

after you transitioned

um

it obviously changed the way you look my

life's changed your life changed right

has dating been

more difficult after uh

you know

your transition

so you know i will uh say that uh dating

live of course um

being on like of course i used to use

few of the social apps too

we're humans we want friends we look out

for new people

so then when i was like you know swiping

on you know men in the town

so there were times that um

i would get a lot of swipes because of

my pictures or maybe some guy likes me

or

but the way i look away i talk whatever

so you know someone has liked me and

then then comes the hard part

so before that hard part comes i've kept

in my mind i used to mention transgender

women

so i don't want to question that in in a

separate part does it put you in an

uncomfortable spot when the conversation

gets to there because you know what my

imagine i'm dating a sweet guy tomorrow

and

um a heterosexual guy

so

if the person doesn't know about my past

i have to say eventually right because

i've had a

incident like this back in bomby where i

was dating this guy so i just randomly

met him at a club in south bambi and

so he didn't know about me we met at a

club loud music and everything so he

didn't know about me and then eventually

i found that he was having feelings for

me i would hang out with him for coffees

and everything so eventually i had to

come out to him and tell him so then

it's like i'm liking the guy as well and

if i tell him i'm transitioning so my

what the hell is this oh so it's

of course it is so you know i think

dating side very few people will

understand they have this mind like

a heterosexual guy in my

historic movements and everything that i

would have understood that is the guy

would ask you

why are you operated or you have you

have you been through the process have

you not been through the process or you

look operated this is the kind of things

that i've got because okay how are you

so possible right so that's possible

like someone cannot understand that

you're a transgendered person

okay yeah i'm sorry

so i'm guessing that

the situation would be much worse for

some men it might not be possible right

and that is where my voice was for my

international pageants that i said that

you know

my voice for all those girls my heart

goes out to them

because i've seen a little bit maybe out

of hundred i've seen twenty percent of

it someone who will go through this

eighty percent of it is so hard

their life is said

to say trans women maybe or possible

aspect

what is your opinion on that because

isn't that also kind of celebrating

possible as a trans person so you know i

think beauty pageant video pageants i

would say like since i was in the

india's first transgender beauty pageant

so i think that was fine india so i

think personally that

video pageants are done to empower the

community at this point of time but at

this point at this point of time but

eventually when i go to 2040s 2050s or

beyond that i do see pageants where all

genders are

being celebrated you know so we are

going there

over time

so like if we can only if we say that

let's do miss india for everyone there

will be a problem now because right now

the education has not reached every part

so you know what is specified pronouns

when i say specified pronouns it means

letter do you see me and you will say

okay i'll address her as she her hers

that would be my first reaction reaction

because of the ideal condition condition

right when you see our number it will be

him uh his right so what happens over

here these are called pressure specified

uh pronouns apart from that there are

people who want to be dressed as they

that them right so

uh

non-binary they don't want to

necessarily be called a man or a woman

basically in the binary system

so generally the term generally is very

important a cisgendered man would say

that he has his pronouns as he him his

cisgendered woman would say my pronouns

is she her hers so basically

if you were assigned female at birth and

you identify as a woman so

generally generally she would say that

my pronoun is she her hers but there can

be conditions that she might not

right exactly gender is something which

we

identify

these are the traits of a man he looks

like a man uh the short pant penis

so

but then uh ideally i would say that in

most of the cases they are correct but

there are cases uh where you are not

correct and in no way if it's a 10

percent that doesn't mean that they are

not important of course they are equally

important so

you know we don't know enough people who

have come out as right anything so if

you're not confident what i feel

encourage even

many a times i face situations where i

was not sure that what is the correct

pronoun to use

very politely and there are ways of

asking you can ask that listen mr x or

mrs white or miss x miss by joby okay

i'm not very sure

sorry mr and mrs exactly

the first question you ask every time

you meet someone yeah

every time you're confused

i think you know i'm i have a solution

here just trying to oh

you know the best way to put it politely

is like tomorrow i see someone i would

say hi good evening what are your

pronouns or how can i address you as

yeah how politely you can ask but

natasha

so i just want to understand

how do we make this a thing that people

actually follow

okay um you know what i mean i mean see

again there's a uh i see

educated

working class

probably they are aware of

if you ask you know someone

not within the specified spectrum that

okay you ask me my pronoun before they

will say what is talking

right so it's easier said than done

but there should be a starting point it

has already started in uh in one

location

in one in one section of the society it

has started

uh and we should uh we should try

encouraging it more but then uh how fast

we can do it is a very difficult

question and also

you know

not practical it's not practical i mean

because every conversation doesn't start

like no and also

if mother intention

genuinely interested if you really want

to know ask it otherwise don't really

i have a i have a uh i would severely

mind if someone wants to behave very

inclusive in public and show that oh my

god i'm aware of it and ask what is your

preferred phone number she actually he

or she gives up you know doesn't care

and they don't use them properly don't

use them properly just to be cool

you don't have to ask it ok

so

especially someone who's not very

sensitive about these topics and hasn't

read a lot

she okay this person's pronouns are not

he him

looks like how a man dresses but

the pronoun

like do you apologize do you i do okay

of course okay in a corporate sector i

do think yeah but not all i mean i think

it should be in regular life as well so

i apologize yeah i'm so sorry to you

know but dress you as that so thank you

for making me correct i think how

beautiful you can say that also you know

in many we are trained that how gender

neutral we can be instead of saying that

hi boys and girls hi ladies and

gentlemen

just

i'm addressing you too as guys

guys so tell me so in my office if you

write an email with high guys we have

the right not to respond to you

wow yeah you always have to use gender

neutral language like hi friends and

folks which is no gender someone someone

wrote an email that to the chairman

and the email was declined because it

should be chaired person not chairman

how willing are you to learn

because

i wrote one email saying manpower

planning

my manager declined the meeting saying

make it resource planning because

manpower yeah so gender neutral terms of

the way yeah like hello people it's the

safest

yeah fair yeah and i also think that if

you know you're addressing a crowd

okay if you just say hello folks hello

people everybody feels included yeah

exactly

right

you know what i mean yeah very good

point you know i think psychologically

you feel well i'm a part of it yeah yeah

you're addressing me as well and enough

so about coming up let's talk talk about

sorry coming out let's talk about coming

up how how difficult is it has it been

for you to come out versus like in

general also how difficult i'm sure you

know a lot more stories of

you know queer people how difficult is

it really to come out

it depends on a lot of social and

economic uh you know condition because

uh most of the time financial financial

conditions because for me it was

difficult because

i was not sure uh you know how my family

would react

it wasn't i mean many people would say

that oh you are privileged and you have

a you know you have a very easy life but

then uh i wrote my own story it wasn't

very easy in the beginning because i

also had my share of you know

humiliation and cross questioning and i

was also taken to a doctor that you know

is my son you know

what what is he saying

so but then uh with education if i could

change the mind of my mother and also i

come from a huge joint family with 300

you know relatives with the same surname

i have

successfully changed all their mind

they're very very comfortable with you

know the queer community the lgbtiq

community they know a lot about it

because i have spread word about it so

uh

now it is easy but coming out was

difficult it is still difficult for most

of the people in india

i think it's also a very you know

personal decision whether you really

want to come out or not because if a

straight person is not coming out and

calling out loud in public then i don't

think uh

straight insane

i see my intention is very different

because i am very comfortable i want to

talk about it because there should be

someone who should be talking about are

you willing to make that i'm willing to

make that impact not everyone is

comfortable so

coming out not coming out is something

you know very very personal but it is

still very difficult

when you decide to come out to someone

see i generally i don't look at any

quality i come out to everyone because

i'm just being me

so as i said that in a gym i would still

say oh my god this guy is hot and

obviously my you know it's all almost

like coming out

and then the one question is

and whether you accept it or you don't

accept it it's your problem it's not my

problem

after

you transitioned

right and then they meet you again so

how has that been like because it's like

you have made the change that you wanted

to mm-hmm and you have accepted yourself

but bakilo bibi

still lagging behind

so i think um you know like a lot of

people have uh

my like out of ten friends five has been

lost

in that journey he lost friends yes

because transitioned because i

transitioned they had a problem or

they couldn't take me

whatever you've done you've done with

your body with my body but then they had

a problem i don't know why i still

figured out some time but i tell that

that i think the universe pushed them

out so you're glad

i'm glad good actually it's good

riddance yeah so probably you know

something was there in the karmic

connection so it's gone so i think it's

good because you know if they couldn't

have accepted me during that time so

there's so many other trans women they

will be coming across will do the same

thing right so what's the use

and also let's talk about they don't

want to grow let's also talk about

how unsafe life is for

trans people in general

like i mean you could still afford the

surgery you could

eventually get there but there are so

many people who struggle for like

shelter right there's so many of them

that we see on the streets mm-hmm and

they have also been kind of

demonized

and you know it's almost become

it's become an insult word

as a trans person what do you want to

say because

but people who are struggling out on the

roads also

whatever traffic signals pay red lights

life must be really hard for them right

of course life is i'm sure because you

know

i was doing this uh documentary on uh

the transgender life when i was in my

media college in uh calcutta so what

happened was uh that was my first year i

remember that was my project right so

i literally went shona garcia is one of

the most

highlighted places in the world like for

uh prostitution and for red you know

these work so he went there and i saw

this uh you literally get 15 rupees

a person and a night to millions of

money over there so you saw these trans

girls who are standing and

i on purpose went and i asked because i

wanted to know that johnny to one of

them i asked and she was like going to

get a meal for like you know for a night

by sleeping with someone it touched my

heart like why would she

do this you know why does she has to do

this and go through so much of pain

right so i personally feel that um this

is happening because insensitivity

towards the community first second would

be lack of education again comes back

third is the government how much of

extension of hand the government is

giving as well

talk about being gay and what are the

things that people don't understand

about gay people

i mean uh i'm gay but then i'm not

sexually frustrated

that's what i want to say because the

moment you come out to a straight man

i'm like i have faced this so many times

in my life that i'm getting like oh

don't touch my listeners

there are different kinds of subtle

homophobia i mean you know

you accept a

gay friend but you don't accept your gay

brother

this is

great you know i'm one of those liberal

mothers i wouldn't mind uh my son being

gay next day when the sun comes out i

have this example in my family she

howled and cried my son is gay my son is

gay and what happened to those dialogues

two years back

huh so uh those are subtle homophobia

there are there is subtle homophobia

within the community too there are many

gay people who would say

are they

typical

you are not you know this is not one of

those behaviors this is all the

homophobia what is typical

who is gay he dresses up like he doesn't

have any traits

uh which is like visibly you know just

straight passing by and then you would

say why do so typically this is also a

homophobic behavior homophobic dialogue

i mean

you're too gay for our liking huh you

know so there can be

and what about like what are the common

things that people say to transphobic

you know what i mean

there are various ways you can show it

one is uh which i have faced with silent

discrimination

when i used to work and when i started

working at a company so i would like

initial days when i transitioned i would

definitely feel that you know i was not

a part of the company when people are

having dinner you know lunches together

and everything i would not be called

because in oki or she's transitioning i

don't know what is she doing

this typical mindset of having that oh

she's transitioning means means she's

sleeping around

i'm sorry i'm not available for everyone

you know there's likings between people

right so you know that mindset i think

this these are like what transphobic

behavior end of the day because you are

not playing a part to be together when

you're having lunches to talk to your

fellow colleagues and everything and the

second is i definitely feel that

transgender means easily a lay down

that's the wrong conception i would just

not want to sleep until it's without the

consent of two person why would i get

attracted to every man i have my choices

i have my free will towards the mind so

i think that is one so and then third is

like you know i feel that um

this is changing i believe because with

my uh experience of dating then till

last few years um and i shared this with

my partner as well that earlier things

were like oh she's a trance means

let's meet her at the corner understand

her this and that and everything but

things are changing on that so that's a

transphobic behavior

you know the moment that you see someone

trans transitioning transgender like you

like oh my god i don't want to be

hanging out with the person and

everything but you want to sleep around

have a good time so that's wrong

so i was already discussing this with

natasha um

which is why i'm asking this um can you

do you mind telling us about your

surgeries and the whole process of

transitioning because

like we've already understood key

transition

for a trans person it's a very personal

choice yeah again i mean it's person to

person like whoever wants to do it can

do it whoever doesn't want to do it it's

fine like it's end of the day but for

people who may want to do it

what is

what are the things that people need to

understand about the whole process of

transitioning and the surgeries and

right so i think um i will place it like

this that first of all surgeries are

hard you know when you undergo surgery

it's not easy because i have with my

experience of surgeries i would say that

my pain began from the time my

anesthesia was over that is where the

pain begins because you know

yes the pain and everything comes right

because once you're in the ot table you

don't get to know you just like they put

sedation and you're gone right you're

just um senseless so i think you know

over here i would say that um

the surgeries i've gone through a

series of surgeries so first one being

just one month late first they do some

um hormonal hrt it's hormonal therapy

for rigorous three years

yes that is the first one because uh

during operations

of course that's before the surgery so

what is the first step the first step is

you go to the psychologist and the

psychiatrist

you start having a friend to start

talking right you start talking to them

they tell you to cross dress

that how comfortable are you to to wear

those dresses and feel how women how

women you feel so the cross-dressing

part comes once the green signal is

given by the doctors the psychologist

and the psychiatrist so once they feel

that yes she's ready i remember when i

used to go to my psychologist and

psychiatrist she would make me turn into

the wall and she would sit behind me and

talk she said natasha don't see me just

talk to the one whatever i ask so i went

through that process for almost uh three

years oh i mean because you know they

understand because you know they don't

want a child or a person to transition

and regret a lot of girls who are doing

this at this point of time after

surgeries they are not happy right there

are lots of cases like this so they want

to be 110 sure because it's a it's

non-reversible process right right so

that's an important decision yes

of your life so that is what exactly

when you know then it happens that their

charity happens where your physical

attributes changes right your body

becomes tender your skin becomes softer

you tend to look there's a point when

you will not look manly and you'll not

look womanly that's few months i mean

half a year when i i was so uncond i'm

uncomfortable going out because people

will judge you see you so you it changes

the way you look yes because your

feminine

aspects come out you look softer your

hair goes goes less grows there's a lot

of things to it i'm going into the

details so you know you look very um

very feminine by looks your hair is not

grown it's healthy and you have your

laser sessions because you don't want

beard luckily i didn't go too much so

you know i had less hair but then a lot

of people who has to go right this

friend of mine who wants to transition i

told him that you need five black rupees

for your laser because this huge light

and beard so you know these are the

things that is then then after that a

lot of people wants to do go for body

correction

like um

changing the body contouring

you know

so then you go for your srs

the sex reassignment surgery which is

the gender the gender judgmentals change

then onwards and then the list is

endless

so i had a consent before asking her

this but like you said it's not okay to

ask this to trans people

you know like have you undergone a

surgery or not i think um i think you

know it's already like you're judging

right why you want to get into someone's

parents before you're meeting the person

to know

like why you want to go or you have had

a surgery i mean that shouldn't concern

the person

i think can happen

to her yeah of course yeah so suppose uh

someone is transitioning

as you said that your friend has a lot

of beard right and what if uh this

person decides not to do a laser surgery

and keep the beard how accepting we

would be from the trans community to

accept this person who has transitioned

and has kept i think um if i was a part

of it i would definitely with one

wholeheartedly i would take him

because it's again a person but is it

the is it the regular regular behavior

or is it is it how accepting the

community is okay now i'll put it over

here

see now

how our society is running right when we

see someone uh

our mind is very straight we know

stereotype on this then when we see a

woman she has to have long hair she has

to have a very curvy body she has a

beautiful skin when i see a guy he has

to look a certain way so this pressure

of body contouring how he mentions that

if he doesn't want to go for laser and

grow hair it's very much possible today

i would say it's a freeway let him do

whatever i mean ask the pronouns if it's

she you address her as a she answered

and now we're going to the next segment

called

where i

mess discussion

there may be a lot of queer people

listening to this who i'm pretty sure

you both of you have empowered and you

know and encouraged we might have also

nudged the wrong way because we gave

wrong answers i don't know maybe maybe

we'll know in the comments yeah below in

the comments and please be right

thankfully rightfully

so

now people don't say it

many people in my childhood have called

me

i have several inhibitions about this

statement because being hijra is not a

insult it's not an insult because

hijrahs do exist

so if someone calls me hijrah i would

say

it's factually actually wrong

i don't know the exact definition of a

hijra and because i have a confusion i

would not tag myself as hijra because i

don't know what is exactly that i'm

pretty much sure two hundred percent i'm

gay so i would be comfortable being

called a gay

so i would say i think that's very

savage in itself

many

[Laughter]

so they get very offended because the

people who try to offend you if you

react in a in a way which they were not

expecting they get very offended because

their

i mean i have heard weird comments

beyond this but then i don't want to say

it

is there any way you can say it and

without saying it i will so there's a

hindi word of a genital right which

starts with l yeah so i blue let's call

it ludo

so let's call it ludo so uh so ludo uh

and then i went to my company sent me to

london because of uh because there was a

dinner for all the inclusion work i have

done so they invited me for that so much

london

[Laughter]

okay what about you

what other what are the transphobic

things that are thrown at you and how

can one respond to them

well i think the biggest thing is over

here is the behavior that that have been

facing a very long time when someone

discovers that i'm a transgender woman i

think

it comes like this that you know

behaved very weirdly it was much more

you know larger before this time before

then 2022 because i think uh

stalin discrimination is the most worse

than being verbal because silent

discrimination kills you within imagine

you're going to a place and someone not

being friendly with you

how will you work there how will you

exchange your um

working ideas with others so imagine if

you're working like you're working

somewhere and and you're a trans person

and they are not friendly with you you

can't work

i have left uh companies like that it's

like a job

environment

you're fighting every day like why the

hell am i going to that job if you are

not enjoying that job if you're not

mixing with the rest of the people you

will never enjoy their job so what we

call it is that you are creating a

bubble but you are not integrating

alienated

h2o make bubbles

but it is it couldn't mix yeah i think

these are created by the people around

of course of course because that is

where it starts otherwise how will they

know again you know they need to

understand they need to read they need

to

expect being more

but but what are some transphobic things

that you would want to respond to good

statements

well uh to be very honest i have been

like go to hell

i don't give a

it's not problem

i'm visible and active here so i don't

give forever researchers responses are

like

there are certain people who ask me can

you explain me all this and that and i'm

like darling there is a of course i'm

more than happy to explain go online

understand if you do not understand

let's research but not on the first go

right i mean

how will i be talking about biological

things and first go do you have a

surgery how does it feel do you feel

anything or do something if we start

beating we'll have to beat a lot that we

said but that's absolutely okay this

this episode has been i think eye

opening even for me and i really hope

that both of you also enjoyed being here

and talking about this so before ending

the podcast i want to ask you one final

question and then i promise both of you

can go i've taken too much of your time

define the modern gentleman in one word

and looks like uh natasha is already

unbiased unbiased yes

i've explained

you know men should be

not putting you know things standards

for anything

be you know when you're passing

judgments do it for everyone or don't do

anyone

simple and clear

i would say fluid i mean

you know

try to be more accommodative in the

environment and not for look uh not look

for people who are like you and adapt

and adopt i think it would make your

life easier because if you want to if

you if you find if you look at someone

make an image in your mind you are

creating a baggage your journey is

becoming difficult

not mine

that's pretty interesting thank you so

much both of you for giving this your

time i know i'm gonna be hot lumbagi

podcast but it was important i think

these were all very important

conversations and um i can't wait to

read the comments on this one because

but i mean

but uh thank you again thank you so much

and this is bhagana signing off from yet

another episode of the gentleman show by

the man company

but how many feedback dinner social

media pay attention

the man company you know the drill i'll

see you next time
