- [Narrator] For a modern, stylish man,

grooming is a crucial aspect of his life

and that is why a lot
depends on his grooming kit.

A lot of you may be wondering

what goes into a man's grooming kit.

Today we'll take you through
the essentials you should have

in your grooming kit.

First is hair styling products.

Everyone loves styling their hair,

and for that it is important
you have the right help,

so hair styling products

like good shampoo, hair gel, or wax

should be a part of your grooming kit.

Second is a shower gel.

A shower gel helps clean
your skin, fight odor,

and keeps you fresh.

Third is a shaving kit.

This needs no explanation.

A shaving kit, comprising
of a razor, shaving cream,

shaving brush, trimmer, and
extra blades, is essential.

The Gillette Mach3 razor
with stronger blades

and adjustable head helps
not only shave your beard

but your body too.

Next is a face wash.

Soap is too harsh for your face.

It needs something more sensitive

and that's where a face wash comes in.

It eliminates dirt, impurities,

and removes dead skin from the face.

Fifth is deodorant.

Everyone perspires.

It's natural, but you have to make sure

it doesn't overpower your
scent and leave odor.

It is important to keep a deodorant handy

so you can smell good always.

Last is sunscreen.

You are out most of the time,

traveling for work or enjoying a sport.

You're always exposed to the sun

so it is important to keep a sunscreen.

The SPF blocks the sun

and prevents your skin from getting tan.

These were your grooming kit essentials.
