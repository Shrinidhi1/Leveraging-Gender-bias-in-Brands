people aren't 100 on board

with pansexual they don't know what it

means and in their brains either you're

gay or you're straight

um my parents

didn't grasp it and

it was not something that they wanted

their daughter to be

i'm erica and i'm the communications

lead for sephora prism

our business employee resource group and

i support all things

lgbtqia plus related

it's important to have a group in our

business because it gives us all a sense

of belonging

especially anybody who identifies as

lgbtqia plus but also for allies

i identify as pansexual i define

pansexual as

somebody who loves everybody not

necessarily a specific gender i don't

care who you are

and what you identify as if you're a

wonderful person i will love you

i always knew in my heart that i was

just open to anything and everything and

i didn't know

what type of capacity that really meant

i grew up in western new york and the

city that i

lived in there weren't a lot of people

like me growing up

at least that were out and proud of that

so coming out was very difficult my

parents were not

accepting in the beginning at all that

was very tough because i did grow up as

a daddy's girl

and my mom she's my best friend but

it felt different so

i didn't really talk to my parents i

kind of

backed away and reverted into my shell a

little bit

and that was really difficult

i started sephora back in 2012 as a

part-time cashier

once i stepped into the sephora space

that was the moment where i felt the

most authentic and the most myself

i always felt like i had to work extra

hard

to be erica but i found out that you

don't have to work extra hard

when you know you belong somewhere

everybody feels like family and

i really do feel like we're kind of all

cut from the same cloth in a sense

even though we're all very different we

all still have the same core values

that's where i really fell in love with

the company shortly after that

there was an open role at corporate

headquarters

and i got my dream job

now i am unapologetically myself to show

other people that you can be who you are

and that is 100

more than okay when i go back home my

family is very close

and that feels incredible

when i look in the mirror

i see somebody who has

overcome a lot i see somebody who is

strong

working on her confidence and also

somebody that has found her place

i can finally be proud of who i am
