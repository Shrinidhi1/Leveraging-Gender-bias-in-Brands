okay so i'm here to show you the latest

eavesdrop

blurring skin tint this is the perfect

foundation for the no makeup

makeup days it just evens out my skin

tone and delivers a

soft blurring finish i want to make sure

there's a foundation option for

all types of people and all different

types of lifestyle so if you don't like

full coverage or if you're someone who

wears like a tinted moisturizer this

one's for you

you can see how quickly it blends into

my skin and instantly gives that

blurring effect

the lighter coverage and the more

neutral undertones are so flexible

we're able to capture our full 50 shade

range in 25

shades everyone who found their pro

filter shade has an eavesdrop shade

i wear shade number 13 which is great

for everyone who wears 310 to 320 inner

pro filter foundations

to apply just shake and use two or three

drops

blend it with your fingers or you can

use the precision makeup sponge

or the full body foundation brush to

buff it into the skin
