Marilyn Monroe and N°5 Perfume

"What do you wear to sleep?"

"Only a few drops of N°5..."

Maybe she was asked about it when she got off the plane?

Maybe at a press conference?

We might not know  Know, when did she say this for the first time?

April 7, 1952

Marilyn Monroe was 26 years old. For the

first time, she became the cover character of "Life" magazine. For the

first time, she talked about N°5  This famous quote was made public and

her saga with N°5 was born Photographed for Modern Screen,

She was at the time.  Filming of the
film "Let's Love" directed by George Cook and starring Yves Montand

Naturally, she talks about N°5 again

This recording has never been released before



Chanel obtained the interview in October 2012  For the

first time

we heard Marilyn Monroe herself talk
about the legendary "A Few Drops of N°5"

You know, people would ask me questions

like

"What do you wear to sleep?"

"Wear  Pajamas? A nightdress?"

"Or a nightgown?"

So I replied: Chanel N°5

because it is true!

I don't want to say "without a strand"

but...it's true

Marilyn Monroe and N°5, forever legendary
