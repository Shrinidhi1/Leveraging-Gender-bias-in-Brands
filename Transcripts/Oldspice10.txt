will nothing save us from this unholy

curse

there is a curse upon every man across

this dark and dangerous land no one can

run no one can hide from the petals of

b.o

nothing we do will make it go all twice

does not yet exist so everyone smells

quite awful

in the bath house one would think i wish

he could wash away the stink but with

this soup of dirt and grime his tent

should be a crime

[Music]

one day in the future old spice will be

our savior till that day comes a pits

will smell and a nose is condemned to

pungent

but in 700 years when the gods of smell

see fit long-lasting old spice will save

our armpits

he'd be dead by them

[Music]
