here we are with the creator of banty

Beauty Breanna we're gonna show you how

to get the Fendi face so to start with

we're gonna use the primer one of the

things I really love about it is the

color it's like this soft pinky nude

it's really feminine it's not that white

chalky color and it's amazing because it

works on every skin tone cool so now

we're gonna get into the foundation I

wanted to make sure all skin tones were

covered I wanted it to look my perfect

skin not like makeup on skin these are

really cool you know they're magnetic

these come in 20 shades I want another

girl to have their color another

consistency there's on it if it goes in

cream to powder shows things I like to

look at these shimmer sticks like I look

at my clothes in the closet

eventually you have like eight of these

between the matte States and the shimmer

Stix the kilowatt freestyle highlight

there's such a high shine look at that

oh wow just like one tape is the

invisible blotting powder I made sure

that we found the formula that works for

all skin tones something that was

completely mattifying but something that

you could put on throughout the day as

many times as you want without it

kicking up
