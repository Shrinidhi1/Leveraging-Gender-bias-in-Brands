- Hey shoulder to shoulder line up!

Line up!

My mission as a coach
and mentor is to be able

to build men for others
when they get to a point

in life where they have to
provide for someone else

other than themselves.

We're gonna show who we're playing

that we are the best.

We just don't look the
part, we are the part.

Everybody understand that?

I always tell my guys that
this day can be better

than the day before
and the way you do that

is you get up.

You gotta look at
yourself through a mirror

and figure out what's
missing and then get better

so every time you get up in the morning

you're always looking at
something that's improving.

Good job, how's it feel?

- Good.

- Feels good, now just
taste it keep working.

We try to instill the habits that help you

to excel and be better at what it is

you want to do.

Feels good to be fresh, look good,

and then you feel good.

And when you feel good,
we say you play good.

And also you excel in
school or anything else

you do outside of the field.
