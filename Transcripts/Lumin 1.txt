I go to sleep with it on I wake up and I

look well rested I started incorporating

skin care into my self-care routine

because I noticed that I was getting

some under eye dark circles and then my

skin was starting to look a little

dehydrated after trying a few different

lines I landed on Lumen because the

difference was noticeable immediately

for step one this is the charcoal

cleanser this is especially great for

anyone who works out frequently like I

do is outside all day or just really

wants a deep pore cleanse to remove

build up from dirt or pollution the

charcoal absorbs impurities and helps to

detoxify your skin step two this is the

exfoliating rub lumens exfoliating rub

is made from charcoal and rosemary leaf

extract now I use this no more than

three times a week to help with skin

regeneration and remove dead skin and

build up it also helps prevent shaving

irritation and over time has actually

reduced the appearance of acne scarring

step three this is the moisturizing bomb

Lumen offers a more tailored variety of

moisturizers depending on your age and

your skin type I have combination skin

so I like to use it every day before I

go to sleep and in the mornings when I

have areas that are dry

now this is my favorite product from the

Lumen skin line it's the dark circle

defense which helps rehydrate decreases

hyperpigmentation and age spots I

finished my nightly routine with this so

I go to sleep with it on I wake up and I

look well rested
