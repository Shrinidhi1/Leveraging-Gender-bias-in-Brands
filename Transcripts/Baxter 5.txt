Don't care what people think of you just
continue to do what you do

and don't be focused on what other people put in your
head

Remember where you came from, no matter where you go. Remember where you started, and remember what got you there

and remember what fueled you to
get to where you're at

So remember where you came fromâ€”that's what keeps you real and keeps you from turning fake in Los Angeles
