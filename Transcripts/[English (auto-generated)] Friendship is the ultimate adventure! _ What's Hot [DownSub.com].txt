the next question is

oh sorry I don't know what I'm ready for

but I'm ready

well I can go on and on about famous

dialogues from Bollywood on friendship

but today I am here on the streets of

korega Park to find some answers as to

what friendship means to people so let's

go ahead and have this fun Gap shop with

puderi public in association with the

man company

[Music]

ah it's a comfort I guess

that's it that's a comfort zone

wow that's uh

right I think friendship is an

experience

it's it's uh it's different for

everybody

and that's one sentence

the loyalty

honesty

yeah uh someone who could be there for

you all the time uh keeping through

thick and thin I guess not just having a

friend not having friends who are there

for you when things are going well

having friends who are there for you and

times are tough a relation where you

don't have to think and you can just

unload yourself I think yeah

I think that that's what friendship is

if you can do that to someone with

someone and I think that's it uh sending

memes

[Music]

today are all about that right I mean we

all have those friends who we never talk

to but like we only just means yeah I'm

sure a lot of you can relate to it

yes absolutely I think friendship should

be thought of as genderless

if someone is your friend then they are

your friend age and gender and

everything else doesn't matter

[Music]

what a wonderful thought I love it yeah

after a certain period has passed

between that friendship

after a year if girl is giving nobody

then yeah friends otherwise

I don't think so I don't have that much

comfort the friend in like a male friend

so I don't think so

dual power absolutely I think they can I

think it's I have a couple of friends

and I've just been friends with them so

I think it it depends you know if both

is the intent is clear I think it is

possible yeah

[Music]

friends friends obviously friends

friends and friends I think that's

everybody is driving just like that's

the only answer we're getting guys we

need more variety Hello friends

um yeah okay How I Met Your Mother what

about how I met your mother is it is it

yeah okay I'd say How I Met Your Mother

and How I Met Your Mother Big Bang

Theory Big Bang Theory yeah

like we know Brooklyn nine nine so

there's this really famous and popular

kdrama called uh reply 1988 pictures and

uh mirzapur

it was about friendship

that

[Music]

um I never say anything wrong behind

your back behind their back even if

things are not fine between y'all

because at the end of the day they are

always there for you uh choices it has

taught me that I can choose who I want

to spend time with and

um it's taught me to Value people in

relationships patience that you can fall

back to those people when you need them

I think yeah that's what has taught me

and and you can be the one to other your

friends also I think both ways yeah yeah

yeah yeah you can have someone to look

up to and when you're a need for

anything yeah yeah except other people's

flaws I'd say because after being

friends with someone for so long there's

a point of time you very tend to drift

apart from your friends especially your

childhood friend so it's about accepting

other people's flaws and understanding

that you're the truest of your friends

are the people that accept you off relax

my friends I was in an all-gai school

and I'm shy when it comes to women in

any case

I have no guy friends

yeah and why is that uh

uh I don't know just always been that

way I'm a biker so I think my majority

of my community are guys so that's why

girlfriends absolutely

guy friends of you girls um yeah

yeah I have balanced

[Music]

I'd like to think I'm the 2AM friend but

I do have my do not disturb moments

I think we need to talk to your friends

about this question yes I am definitely

the 2AM friend yeah yeah do your friends

think so too absolutely absolutely and I

am the guy that people call for like

advice 2 am breakups parties always I'm

always there

phone who are uh who can call me at 2 am
