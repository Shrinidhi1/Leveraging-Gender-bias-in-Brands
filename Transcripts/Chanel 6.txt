desire and to be she found endless

combinations to fuse her ideas this is

conqueror who transformed her rebellion

into an art choose your destiny even if

you have to reinvent your path blend

true with false and do not let fate

control the outcome leave the past

behind and let instinct be your guide

over excess comfort over appearance and

intuition over principles change what
