the Arts represent the soul of a city

and so was she and X coming to the city

it helps to reflect the inclusivity when

I heard that Xi'an wanted to do this

project to celebrate aapi heritage month

I was super excited to be able to

represent my Filipino Heritage as well

as my Asian Heritage and be

collaborating with such an amazing

company like Xi'an I love that Sheehan

is coming here to put us on the map and

that they are seeking out local artists

and taking their money and giving back

to the art community especially in this

area there's nothing like this that ever

happened before for over 30 years

there's there's no public art in this

area and it's always nice to meet people

and get interact with other artists you

get to know them you get to know their

style this is what this event is really

celebrating the different types of Asian

cultures and that we're all we're all

people and we all need to love

diversity and the unity that makes

Houston a remarkable City

and the reflection of who we are as the

culture the culture yes and um and the

culture establishes the personality yes

gave us full creative freedom just to

paint whatever we wanted

as long as they just fit the AAP which

I'm happy to do as a API artist when

Houston native born and raised first

Heritage it's full of color and then

just messaging around women empowerments

cat is just perfect yes oh and then we

got this cute little bag

so we really appreciate seeing that

creative event for to create exposure

for a lot of local Brands here because

to be honest around here a lot of

franchise and we we needed to give back

to the community that supported us a lot

so thank you very much now definitely

coming from Venezuela from the Latino

culture I definitely enjoy all these

activities to just integrate all the

cultures here in Houston and United

States so it's definitely a great event

I thought it was incredible I mean not

only just the artwork the entire setup

from the food vendors to the business

vendors to all of the people this is

what Houston is all about celebrating

diversity celebrating culture and Sheen

has done a great way to highlight that

honestly I thought it was so cool like

seeing Chien take you know initiative in

the community just the fact that they're

able to be so inclusive to the community

and the culture I think Houston is so

full of culture so it's such a great way

to do it as well so I think of the event

is perfect like

and set out perfectly and then it's

crowded I love it I hope we have like

more events like this well art brings

people together right and so as we're

celebrating culture through aapi month

it brings all people from all

backgrounds together and they're able to

celebrate it and highlight uh the

tremendous talent that we have here in

Houston and then when you look at the

picnic tables that were done that's the

way in which people come and eat

together talk create and it gets to stay

right here in Houston when you look

around this event today Sheen has done a

good job of bringing people together and

everyone is having fun so this has been

incredible right here in this city you
