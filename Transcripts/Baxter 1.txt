it's kind of a beautiful wasteland  there's just this battle between like  structure and nature California is a  place where it's the big leads and if  I'm gonna feel a way about myself as a  creative let me see what it's like out  there  [Music]  you have to be down to like fail nothing  is going to come easy and if it does  it's it's a rarity I guess I get to see  a sort of side of la that little people  don't really get to I've been in it all  my life  I love California and I love LA  [Music]
