hey guys Luke here from Taylor Stitch

I'm here with our lead product designer

Nick Kemp

we just received a huge restock on all

of our boots and so we thought it'd be a

good time to kind of create a video to

talk about what goes into our boots what

the story is behind them the different

styles and some consistencies that we

make sure we keep with every launch

across the board so we've got kind of a

range of our full core assortment here

we're going to kind of talk through

things around just like the general

Styles and some of the construction

details that go into each so we're not

going to go over every single boot but

the kind of the core styles of boot that

we have are really a few and then we

swap out leathers and Soles and kind of

do things to keep it fresh but really

the core assortment consists of the

tried and true classic what we call a

trench boot this is just you know

classic easy wearing boot we do it in a

couple of different Leathers this here

is the whiskey we also do it in this

really great golden brown waxed suede

my my favorite silhouette that we do in

Boots is the ranch boot a classic kind

of pull-on style super comfortable

pretty much wearable with anything you

know a clean kind of Chelsea silhouette

but also a rugged so kind of crosses uh

you know the the whole Spectrum there

and then lastly the Moto boot which is

our uh true dual layer Cap Toe Moto boot

very similar to the trench and actually

not lastly I forgot one but we do the

Rambler chukka this one here is in the

uh really nice suede so

um I'm gonna pass it over to Nick now we

kind of went through the Styles and he

can kind of talk about some of the

construction details that are consistent

across the board yeah so across the

board here all these boots are handmade

and Leon Mexico which is the boot making

capital of the world

um every style we make uh is full

Goodyear welt which means that as when

you wear out that sole you can get the

these resold and they'll be good as new

you have a full hot lined cork insole

stainless steel shank construction and

you have a silicone injected foam insert

on there so these these suckers are as

comfortable as sneakers as soon as you

take them out of the box

every one of these also has a Vibram

sole on it which we consider the gold

standard of rubber soles

um and these these guys are built to

last you a lifetime with proper care and

and um you know everything these suckers

will you know be handed down to the Next

Generation

thanks guys let us know if you have any

questions and uh as always thanks for

all the support cheers
