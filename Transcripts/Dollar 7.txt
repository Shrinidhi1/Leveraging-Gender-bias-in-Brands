welcome to i learned a thing in the

bathroom from dollar shave club where we

explain something very complicated in

mere minutes to occupy your brain while

you shave in this edition we'll be

answering the question what's the most

shocking thing in the kamasutra

as explained by someone who sounds smart

because he's british

the most shocking thing most people

discover when opening the karma sutra

for the first time is that it's not

actually the steamy guide to intricate

sex positions that it's known for being

only around a fifth of the book covers

this topic in fact with the rest being a

philosophical guide to navigating life

relationships and marriage

well that's a bummer where did this book

come from anyway the kama sutra was

compiled over 2000 years ago by the

hindu philosopher vatsyayana

but because it was written in a very

complex form of sanskrit the sacred

language of hinduism it was notoriously

difficult to understand

when a more accessible version called

the ananga ranga was published in the

1600s the original was orbit forgotten

so how do we know about it now

in the 1870s british author richard

burton

not to be confused with the movie star

was attempting to translate the

yanangaranga but kept seeing references

to the original work he ended up having

to piece the kama sutra back together

from sections unearthed in libraries all

across india still it wasn't much more

than a curiosity in the west until the

1960s when the hippie culture became

infatuated with indian mysticism and the

book's popularity soared remember when

the beatles started adding a sitter to

every song

that's pretty much when it happened okay

but why does everyone think of it as

some kind of sexy sex guide if it's not

a sexy sex guide i just like saying sexy

sex guy

because there's always a market for sexy

self-help literature a few unscrupulous

publishers printed versions with just

the passages that deal with that stuff

one of these versions was distributed on

the internet in the early 90s forever

cementing the book's reputation as a

piece of novelty erotica well while i

appreciate the history lesson i can't

help feeling you're trying to dodge the

question here what's the most shocking

thing in the kama sutra and i want a

real answer not some of your repressed

british bullsh most of the more

memorable sex positions in the kama

sutra aren't shocking as such they're

just impossibly difficult to accomplish

there is one for example which suggests

that the man should sit on the edge of

the bed while the woman straddling him

bends right back until the top of her

head is touching the floor unless you

have extremely flexible anatomy that's

going to end in a very painful trip to

the emergency room

most of what's actually feasible in

there won't surprise the average person

these days a generation brought up with

the internet and before that

cosmopolitan is more likely to be

shocked by how tame it is than anything

else well now i feel unfulfilled and

slightly angry

you and everyone i've ever slept with

ouch tune in next time for more i

learned a thing in the bathroom and in

the meantime head to

dollarshaveclub.com for more podcasts

and a big old pile of grooming products
