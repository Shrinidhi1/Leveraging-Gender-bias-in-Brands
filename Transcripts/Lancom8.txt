so i'm going to tell you a little bit

about lancome's new genifique eye cream

and how i like to use it

first you take just a little bit

of the cream about a pea size mix it

together like this

then you take both your index fingers

like this

right underneath your eye and you swipe

three times and then you take your two

middle fingers

and you go right above the eyelid three

times the magic number

now onto the next step you take both

your fingers again on both hands

you hold it here and as you move it out

you also separate your other fingers and

you massage outwards

and then obviously we have to do the

other side

very lightly and smoothly three times

and now on to my favorite part which is

kind of like playing piano on your

eyelids

voila my eyes are brighter and stronger

[Music]

feels amazing what do you think
