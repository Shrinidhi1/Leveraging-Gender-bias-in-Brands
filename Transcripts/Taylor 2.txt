rolling yeah rolling all right hey y'all

Nick from Taylor Stitch uh today we are

gonna do a little uh re-waxing tutorial

so first we need a good old used jacket

here's one of our favorites the old

Rover jacket as you can see a lot of

wear the wax will start to just kind of

like rub off and and just kind of like

Get get dry spots on it so um usually

you can you can see this it kind of like

sticks out from the rest of the jackets

usually where things are a little bit

dry and not as glossy looking right and

uh you can um touch those spots up with

a little bit of um the TS favorite otter

wax here

um here we just have a re-waxing bar

and uh what you're going to want to do

is find some areas on the jacket that

are a little bit dried out and you're

just going to want to take this bar

and just start hitting those areas I

like to go in a little circular motion

uh and it'll take some friction to get

that wax a little bit warm and start

coming off

onto the fabric

you can kind of see here we're getting

getting some going

and I just kind of start at one point

and just kind of keep keep circling it

out

foreign

as you can see that kind of sticks out

from the the rest of the

the jacket right so we're just going to

want to get that soaked in so we're

going to take a little uh hot air gun

here or you can use a blow dryer if that

is your flavor

and same as we did with the bar we just

kind of want to work it in a circular

motion

again we're just trying to get that wax

to heat up a little bit

and uh just kind of work it in to the

fabric I also will use kind of my hands

as well you can also use otter wax sells

this great Little Brush as well that you

can use you can also use this brush to

kind of clean off some excess dirt as

well

um and and once that gets heated up it

kind of starts to sink into the jacket I

do let this cure for about 24 hours

before I'm actually going to wear it or

put it in into use

um and then you can just again kind of

continue around uh the jacket or

whatever piece you're kind of working on

and just kind of spot treat you can also

take this same kind of idea to wax a

garment that has never been waxed and

you can just take this bar and kind of

do that same uh motion throughout the

entire jacket and heating it up in

different you know kind of sections and

you can wax a whole jacket

thanks for your time

go have a good one
