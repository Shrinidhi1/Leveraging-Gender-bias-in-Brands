- [Narrator] College is a
wonderful place to be at.

You make new friends, have fun,

and unlike school finally get
to dress up the way you want.

But since college life is eventful,

we want you to stand out
and make an impression.

So here are some quick tips
on getting ready for college.

First and foremost,
let's talk about grooming

your haircut and beard.

When it comes to your
hair, keep it simple.

An undercut is the current hair trend,

which is shorter on the
sides and longer on the top,

and is set with wax.

Tip two, a lot of you might be
getting the peach fuzz beard,

patchy in places, and not fully grown.

So it is important you shave.

Use the Gillette SkinGuard Razor.

It gives you a smooth shave,

and in case you have any
acne or skin irritation,

the unique skin guard
position between the blades

gives you a comfortable
shave without any irritation.

Now the third tip is clothes.

You don't need to spend
a lot to look good.

Simple, solid colored T-shirts with little

or no print does the trick.

They make you look cool and classy.

You can also add casual checkered shirts

or polo neck T-shirts to your wardrobe.

Fourth tip, avoid wearing
shorts to college.

Instead, wear good fitting jeans

or chinos for your everyday look.

Fifth tip, let's talk about shoes.

For college you need a pair
of sneakers or boat shoes.

They are stylish, trendy,
and look really good

with almost everything you wear.

Invest in a pair of good sneakers.

Sixth tip is accessories.

A wristwatch can never go out of fashion,

so you can always go for a metal strap

or a sporty digital watch.

You can also wear bands or
other fashion accessories

on your hand to add to your look.

The final and the most
important tip is body language.

It helps to break the
barrier of unfamiliarity

and helps to form a better
connect with everyone.

So these were some useful tips to consider

while you get ready for college.
