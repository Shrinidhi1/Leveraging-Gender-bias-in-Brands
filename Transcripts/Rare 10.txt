I think people have tried to Define me a

lot in my life but I've definitely grown

into myself my lineage is indigenous I'm

very much like a free spirit 100 black

100 Latina

it doesn't really make sense but it

feels good this is a love letter to our

beautiful community

show the world What You're Made Of I am

made of my last name and my Heritage

they're the reason I am who I am my mom

and my grandma I am made of strength joy

and compassion the resilience of my

ancestors That Make Me Feel Like

Anything is Possible people who don't

try to change me in any way race color

shape size

thank you for being you

what are you made of
