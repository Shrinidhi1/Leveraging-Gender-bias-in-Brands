hey guys how's it going Luke from TS

here hey uh today we want to talk about

how to care for uh your Taylor Stitch

boots really this goes for any uh you

know nice Quality Boot or shoes pretty

similar process across the board we've

got a couple different

um of our boot Styles here to kind of

showcase

um really before we even get into that

um some nice things about our Boots

These are going to last you a long time

if you take care of them and so that's

kind of why this cleaning and

conditioning process is a little bit

important all of our boots use a

Goodyear welt construction which is

great I kind of tell folks like hey if

you buy our boots you should probably

plan on resolding them someday because

they shouldn't last you that long if you

take care of them we also do some things

with our boots that make them kind of

unique they have like a cork midsole

which a lot of brands use it's super

comfortable we also use a silicone

injected insole almost like a sneaker

style so they're really comfortable

right out of the box this is our Ranch

boot this is my personal favorite boot I

wear these all the the time and then

this is our Moto boot we do both of

these in a handful of different Leathers

we've also got a couple other styles so

check out the website but really what

we're going to do to get into it today

is just kind of show the cleaning and

Care process to do that you know just

get yourself like some pretty basic uh

setup items really all you need is a

brush and some good quality conditioner

I like this stuff right here this

Cadillac but even some just old-school

Mingo oil will get the job done as well

and then a cloth that's about all you

really need you know I like to use a

couple different brushes

I like one like this with a little bit

of a shorter uh bristle to it so that

that way you can kind of get in there

it's a little bit stiffer than the

longer brush but if this is all you got

it's going to get the job done

um so really what I do is I knock the

heavy stuff off first get in there in

the well and just make sure you get all

that dirt out of there that's like one

of the most important areas to clean

because that dirt over time is going to

kind of cause a grit and abrasion in

there and just wear down the welt so

make sure first of all you hit that

really nice with the brush

you can see back there we've got a

little bit of dirt in some cases like a

damp towel might help get some of that

stuff out of there we don't have one in

front of us right now but

um you could certainly do that

and then I take a bit of a longer brush

and just make sure the whole thing's

kind of clear of dirt debris give

yourself a nice clean starting point so

that as you start to condition that

leather it's you're not just rubbing

dirt into it right get all that stuff

off the surface

I like to hit the soles too you can see

these are a little bit dirty you

probably should have cleaned these up a

little bit before we started

um but hey these will work

so from there all you really got to do

let's get your towel I like this one has

kind of a different surface on both

sides it's a little bit brushed and soft

a little bit of leather conditioner goes

a long way

I like to kind of bat it into the cloth

first

I'd like to get my hand inside gives you

a good way to hold the boot and then

just start working it into the surface

you don't have to rub super hard at

first just cover the surface

you're going to start to see some areas

darken that's not a problem those are

going to lighten up a little bit once

the conditioning oil can penetrate the

boot overall

and I'll spare you the time today I

won't go through the whole boot but one

thing you want to do is definitely get

in and around that well that's really

important to keep that leather

conditioned also the high wear areas

like where your toe flexes

just kind of give it a rub in and then I

keep my uh cloth separate I keep one

side for applying the cream and then one

side for removing the excess

just kind of go through lightly you do

want that cream to uh you don't want to

wipe it off entirely sometimes if you've

got the time let it sit for an hour or

so give it a chance to penetrate

but once you get that excess wiped off

you know I'm not pushing hard just

lightly then I come back through with my

brush one more time

just give it a little bit of a buff

that kind of shines the leather up so if

you're not into that look that's cool

you don't have to do that

step

and then I let them rest you know I

usually don't wear them for a couple

days after I condition them you also

don't want to put them in like direct

sunlight but that's kind of the case in

general that can kind of break down the

leather a little bit quicker over time

but other than that you're good to go do

that you know as needed you don't have

to over condition just make sure that

leather is not starting to look cracked

or dried out and you should be good to

go

as always give us a shot if you have any

questions and uh yeah thanks folks
