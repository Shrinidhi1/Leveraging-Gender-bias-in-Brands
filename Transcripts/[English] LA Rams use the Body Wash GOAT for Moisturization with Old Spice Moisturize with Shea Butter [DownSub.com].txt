Ah.

Where is it?

Yo, you good? Bro, have you
seen my Old Spice Body Wash?

It was here before practice and I
can't find it. Your Old Spice?

My Old Spice Moisturize with
Shea Butter. It keeps my skin

nice and soft. No, I haven't
seen any old spice lately. My

fiance keeps taking my body
wash at home. I thought it

would be safe here. Why can't
people just understand that men

have skin too? Unless it was
coach again. Hmm, probably was

coach. He does have moisturized
skin.
