Shafts of sunlight filtered through an evergreen canopy, the scent of dry leaves and damp soil, the gentle bite of a crisp breeze. If you ask us, there’s nothing better than throwing on your trusty pack and setting out into the woods during the first flush of fall…right when the leaves start to turn. Fall is our favorite time of year to gear up and wander the wilds. The Wildwood Collection celebrates that special sense of stillness this time of year brings to the forest, drawing textures and colors from autumnal wilds in cozy garment weights that are perfect for the season. Happy hiking, folks.
