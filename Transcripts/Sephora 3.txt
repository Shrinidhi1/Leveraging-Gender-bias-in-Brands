what is beauty

without black beauty its influence

is universal there'd be no cut creases

or beat faces without these legendary

icons

[Music]

no baby hairs and laid edges

without tight coils and a mother's love

none of the glow none of the shine

if they didn't turn doing it yourself

into doing it for the culture the trends

we love

the tools we need the styles

we can't wait to post

are all black beauty

so it's time we all give black beauty

the credit it deserves

join sephora in supporting and

celebrating black beauty
