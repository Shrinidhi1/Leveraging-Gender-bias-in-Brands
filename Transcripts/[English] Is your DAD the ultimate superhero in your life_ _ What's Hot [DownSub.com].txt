foreign  [Music]  one thing's for sure our relationships  with our dads can be a bit awkward so  today let's talk to some people about  their relationships with their fathers  and why it's so challenging to express  our love to them  [Music]  so here we have a gentleman and a lady  and we'll be asking some interesting  questions from them describe your father  in just one word friend maybe yeah  friend respectful hard-working expert  someone I will get all my knowledge from  I would describe it as loving so do you  think we hold our dads to an  unreasonably high standards I think most  people do but I don't 100 I think it's a  very reasonable standard for me my  father is my motivation I don't feel  like you don't feel like that yes we do  and we have a habit of comparing them to  somebody you know bigger in stature and  then we compare everybody else to our  dads so yeah we do that all the time I  think that a high standard is more  applicable especially when you're young  but then as you grow up you realize okay  we were putting so many expectations out  of at the end of the day he's also human  right to do that so my next question is  I think I am kind of an introvert person  right now it's an interview so I'm just  giving answers so my dad is also of the  same nature anger anger yeah same I  guess you both both of them are angry  yeah  resilience strength patience being calm  at the most  chaotic situation I've got this dimple  my walking style tell me who do you call  more frequently your dad or your mom  call or text my dad and what about you  Mom Mom  yeah Mom of course I call my dad  I text him also Mom Mom I think most of  us do so what was the last text that you  texted your father like what was the  last message  my girlfriend's picture oh and what  about you mother  again  why do you think that we can easily  communicate with our moms but when it  comes to our dad it is not usually the  same I think moms have a little soft  corner for their children so that is the  reason otherwise fathers are little  harder to make them understand so that's  why we prefer to speak with a mom  instead of a father like for me it's  kind of a reverse thing I think as we  are all growing women's we think that  our mom would connect with us more as  they would understand us we women  understand each other better than a  father would I think it's easier to show  towards both of them when I feel like  but yeah I'm open to birth and I love  them I'm more friendlier with my Dad I'm  more close to my dad and I have no issue  sharing any kind of topic that a girl  would share with her mom that I would  share with my dad so have you ever said  I love you to your dad and if yes then  what when was it like the last time that  you said I love you that yesterday also  that was a long long time ago years ago  not frequently maybe once in a blue moon  make it in a year but otherwise daily in  my remembrance for sure I did that today  morning can we have that right now too  love you Papa hello Papa ah I love you  probably a month ago I say it every day  I said it just before I left my house  today morning when he dropped me off to  the mall  so sweet and what was his reaction like  he just hugged me yeah  yes never yes I have and you know as a  matter of fact the first time that I  really saw him crying crying emotional  was when I got married I think maybe  when his mom passed away yeah many times  yes I have and it's mostly when I get  hurt he also gets hurt seeing me hurt  one of the moments that you can recall  when I performed this kathak performance  and he was really proud and he was  standing and clapping and he was really  happy and emotional about it do you  think we can do anything to improve our  communication with our dad spend more  time with her dad  I think it is both ways both the party  should be willing to you know put in an  effort in making their relationship  better I think we spend more time  talking to moms giving them more time  and you know spending more time with  them I think time is the key you spend  more time you get to know them more  that's an indirect way of knowing and  you know getting closer to one another I  think time for me is the case  [Music]  every day when I wake up I see him first  then I go and do anything else so that's  the first thing I hug him and every day  at night when I say good night I hug him  oh yes all the time I love hugging him  you know we'll be lucky to see that  happening right now live on the camera  yes of course  that's now the last question there you  go describe the modern gentle man in one  word  one who believe that for the future for  their children so it's a blend of  everything if you ask me what I feel is  a difference since I'm a mom and my  husband of course is a father so what I  feel is different from in a modern day  man from a dad who was like you know  some 20 years ago is the involvement  with the kids we just go with the flu  and treat everyone nicely impatient  and you generous my dad obviously now  that's a super ban so for sure I hope  your dad gets to watch this for sure so  here is something very special for
