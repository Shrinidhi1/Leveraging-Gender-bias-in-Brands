i think makeup for me

has just been life-changing my mom has

always been

super glamorous when i was little she's

having me like put on her lipstick for

her

this has always been my normal so for me

like when i grew up i was like i want

makeup but i

suppress that forever and then when i

got my first makeup then it was like all

right well we've already put our

toe in the water like swim in the pond

[Music]

my name is patrick and i am the stage

experience lead at sephora

growing up in a smaller town i was

afraid to be who i was

i was afraid to wear what i wanted

one time i had done like more than

normal for school

and i had makeup on and i came home that

day and i had wiped it off because

people were judging me

and my mom asked me why did you take

everything off

i saw the way you looked at yourself

when you left and i don't know what

changed in between

when i was in the 10th grade i told five

friends that i was gay

by lunchtime a girl announced to the

whole cafeteria that i was gay

and i went to the bathroom and i just

cried and let it out and then i went

home for the day

i don't know what happened i don't know

if a spirit entered me but like that

night i like made a change

people are gonna tear me down my whole

life and tell me that there's things

wrong with me and there isn't

[Music]

i've been at sephora for seven years i

started right out of high school

one day i was in my mall and i went into

the sephora and i had

full makeup on i'll never forget the

woman behind the counter

came up to me and was like hi you have a

job

[Music]

[Applause]

i love working there because i work with

really diverse people

and i think that sephora is really

getting behind

movements and really supporting their

people and changing people's lives

it's super important that we change the

conversation about makeup because

makeup has always been genderless my

gender identity is gender non-binary

and my preferred pronouns are they them

i created a drag persona named christina

i needed someone who was unapologetic

and someone who wasn't afraid to be

themselves

when i throw on the wig or i throw on

lashes there's like a little bend in my

neck

and i just become more confident and i

think that christina's whole message is

to be kind

and be nice to people christina showed

up for me

so that i could show up for other people

[Music]

if i could talk to my 11 year old self i

would have

a long conversation i would be like get

comfortable it's okay that i

felt different then and that i felt

strange

and that i felt like a freak because

i don't feel like a freak anymore

[Music]

i think if i could have the world know a

couple things about me i would tell them

this isn't a phase we just want to exist

and be happy and have people just accept

us for who we are

the inevitable goal is that we would all

live in a place where we just loved each

other for who we are regardless of who

we are
