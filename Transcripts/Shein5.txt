hi hi girl thank you so much for

choosing me to be your partner fashion

should just be fun and colorful

this feels very weird being so far from

each other I'm so excited to be working

together I don't speak English that's

okay we will just use chat

we've called our collection

Eterna

Eterna means Timeless in Spanish I'm

surrounded by Nature here in Arizona we

have beautiful mountains we have a

beautiful sky view those things really

made this become the sky is the limit

collection

just finished my first meeting with

Deborah I already have an idea of what I

want the collection to look like the

name of our collection is extent and

it's a play on the theme of x

I feel like we should definitely work

with your flowers and create something

just really bold yes it's a good idea

our collection is called chasmo this one

here is almost ready and we wanted to do

it on this kimono one yes on the back

our name for this collection is

enlightened

I love all the different colors like the

Reds and the pinks and the orange they

look really really good

our collection is part animal part

Resort where so the wild ethno which is

the perfect title for the collection

the hardest part of the design process

is narrowing down some of our crazy

ideas to make sure that they're

understandable to everyone our

collaboration is named till C Street I

got some things done hopefully you like

what I have amazing

the name of our project is Sparks of

transformation and what it pretty much

represents is people coming out and

being free being free and who they are

and living in your truth it's been a lot

of different back and forth I did some

sketches as well I came up with three

girls but I wanted to make them kind of

look like aliens like with some elf ears

our collection is called GXP it's a

fantasy Motocross brand I don't think

there's any time to sleep like we

literally have two days

deadlines it's always a little bit

nerve-wracking you want this to be a

perfect collection we're almost there

but we still have work to do

the name of our collaboration is Hotel X

I love what you did with the print

placement I think it's stunning together

I can't wait to see what this looks like

in real life

girl I just think that we Both Deserve

like a good old Pat on a bag

okay they finally arrived I am so pumped

are you excited you ready

you look so cute I love the way the

colors came out I love the jacket I

think it turned out perfect oh

oh wow that's so beautiful I really

really love it

so cute

oh my God it looks so good on you

my favorite piece for sure is the suit I

love it so much yeah

it feels a bit surreal grateful for the

opportunity to be able to create

something and have it out there in the

world looking at these garments I am

absolutely Amazed by what we have both

created

I'm just really excited to see how other

people are going to wear them and style

them

you can see the artist you can see the

inspiration behind the prints we wanted

to make sure that that really came

through I think we together could

transform an idea that is very abstract

to something beautiful I think that's

amazing I really liked it this

collaboration is a huge and valuable

experience for me it means a lot when

you have an artist and a designer coming

together to create magical piece that

comes together and says that is Art we

definitely thank you she in for merging

the gap

is yours
