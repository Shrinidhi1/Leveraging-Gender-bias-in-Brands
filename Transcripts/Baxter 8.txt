I mean maybe I would have done something
crazy earlier in my life if I had grown up differently

I was an only child,
and I didn't live with my dad

so I actually like, I was not afraid, but I wasn't rebellious enough

It's amazing how much of my transformation happened in my life after I turned 18

Yeah, it's been one hell of a ride.
