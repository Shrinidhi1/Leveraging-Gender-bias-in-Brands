okay okay what are we doing today

this is one of my favorite looks and

i've been rocking this for a minute now

no makeup makeup look summer fancy face

all right real talk so we're going to

show you how to accomplish that look

starting with a whole little family

right here hey now cheeks out is our

cream bronzer and our cream blush these

products are really lightweight they're

also meant to be applied any way you

want to really but a brush is usually a

lot more convenient for me because i'm

always in a rush like makeup and out

but jennifer over here

i love a finger

so jennifer over here

i love to use my fingers

i do not use a brush it's meant to have

a marriage with your makeup your

foundation your powder whatever you have

on your face you can use this on your

eyes your cheeks your forehead so i'm

going to start on the lower end here

i'm using my bronzer brush here because

what works for the dry formula it also

works for our cream bronzer so you can

go right in like that and then you can

blend it out and have a little bit of

contour when i get to my forehead

i really go in because i have a big

forehead so i have to go for it

i'm saying look at it i'm pouring this

into my foundation that's already there

and look it just becomes more like skin

than anything else you can't tell that i

have on any makeup in this corner right

here that is something that's very

special when you're on the beach

or you just want to wake up next to your

man looking like you don't have on

makeup

check it out though we like things that

look like skin we like them to look

natural not greasy

who likes grease

not you know that that's i don't play

that we just do dewy

okay so as you can see i'm also

contouring my jawline same cream bronzer

the shade i'm using right now is honey

glaze because it's really warm and it

fits my complexion really perfectly it's

giving me this dew this glow it's

natural it's summertime so what i like

to do is use this color amber i like to

use it on the contour region because it

creates like a natural shadow and i'm

just going to line like that it's not

lighter or darker it's just a shadow and

it's there all day long and you can have

this in a cream formula now this is our

summertime base

and we're not done i'm going to show you

the second half of our cheeks out

collection for the summer

which is a part of our no makeup makeup

look

summer fancy face first fenty beauty

blush ever it's all about the moods

though we have 10.

let's start with petal popping i like to

just pat it on like a little paw and

then i go in a circle just to create

that little rosy cheek and then i drag

up a little bit into the jawline and

then if i want more i do more does it

look like i'm overdoing it jen no ma'am

because it's what

impossible to overdo that's right

so the next side i'm gonna give you

summertime wine because this is one of

my other favorite colors i'm going to do

this with my fingers just so you can see

that you can do it both ways that is

really what this product is all about

the flexibility and look at that boom

i wasn't lying

no fingerprints no blotches it's really

really something serious i'm just

filling in my brows real quick what are

you doing over there jen i'm just

throwing on a little drama class that's

the thing we wanted to talk to you guys

about now look how crazy this color

looks what is purple gonna look like on

my cheek

let me show you you see that it's not

scary at all it's beautiful and it

really just has such a sheer beautiful

effect it works on every skin tone

don't i look beach ready

or booty call ready

i'm actually dabbing one of my favorite

colors summertime when i made love

just add a little bit of gloss foam on

there so you have a little bit of

pigment behind the iconic fenty beauty

lip shine

oh that

oh

look at my lips and that look at look at

it jen come

everybody loves it and everyone bought

it but it's worth it look at it okay
