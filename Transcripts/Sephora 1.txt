i was born on the wonderful island of

jamaica

my formative years were there and i did

not realize i was poor

i wanted to have people see that you

know someone who looks like me

who came from where i came from could

create something

that is now available to the whole world

everything is possible

i'm dr rosemary engleton and i'm the

founder of rose ingleton

md skincare truthfully i'm a unicorn in

this space

i'm a dermatologist with over 20 years

of experience

i created my skincare line for my

patients

i was inspired by them the products are

for

everyone i wanted it to appeal to men

women older younger folk

when i created my line my dream was

always

to end up at sephora anything that came

before that was building to that

and then sephora found me it was amazing

our ethos are so aligned so to be

finally a part of the sephora family

being on sephora.com is absolutely

the answering of a dream

[Music]

i can't tell you how much my parents

constant support

has been what made me really thrive

my family always had a lot of fruit

around the house and

it wasn't until after my training really

when i realized that a lot of the fruit

products that we were ingesting

had skin benefits

my mother she was always meticulous

about cleansing her skin

she was using the things we had around

the home

granules from the kitchen that would

give her the benefit of an exfoliation

what i did learn from her was the

importance of

cleaning your skin

i first created a moisturizer

it has all of the great stuff in there

that i thought you need for

just basic good skin health that's

totally separate from my jamaican

superfruit blend which is what makes my

products

special that is my secret sauce and

that's what ties back to my heritage

all the fruit extracts that i put in

there and the hyaluronic acid and all of

that

that's what makes it stand apart i

definitely focused on making sure that

the products

were being cleanly sourced

the product is literally vegan

[Music]

i wanted to be able to reach as many

people from as many backgrounds as

possible

and to show inclusivity in my product

line and now

being a part of sephora showing

inclusivity in the representation of

brands on their shelves

is a really perfect union

[Music]

you
