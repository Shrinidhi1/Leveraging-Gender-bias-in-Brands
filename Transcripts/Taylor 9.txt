surfing is a parachute for my life

it connects to my art in the sense that

they're both forms of release and

freedom for me

[Music]

surfing doesn't necessarily have a right

or wrong way to do it and neither does

making stuff

finding out that I was able to

collaborate and do things with people

that were like-minded and brands that I

enjoyed really was like an exciting

Revelation for me that I could have some

sort of synergy between the two

[Music]

in terms of the visual language of what

I create It's relatively minimal Coastal

not too serious

you know the playfulness of being in the

ocean the playfulness of drawing things

on the on the paper are the same as they

were when I started doing them when I

was a little kid as they are now as a as

a bigger kid

[Music]
