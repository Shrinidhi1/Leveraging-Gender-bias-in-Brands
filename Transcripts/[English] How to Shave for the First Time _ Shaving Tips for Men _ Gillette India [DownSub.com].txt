- [Announcer] Want to
start shaving your beard

but not sure on how to start?

Here are a few tips for all you guys

shaving for the first time.

The most important thing is identifying

when to start shaving.

Ideally, you should only start shaving

when you start getting a peach fuzz.

A peach fuzz is that slight patchy beard

and mustache grown as a teenager.

Before we get into the shaving process,

here are the products that are essential

in the shaving routine.

Face wash, Gillette foam
or gel, Gillette razor,

after shave lotion.

First hydrate your skin with warm water,

this will help open up your pores

and soften your facial hair
preventing nicks and burns.

Use a face wash to get rid of
the oil, dirt, and dead skin

preparing your skin for
a comfortable shave.

Then take a small amount
of shaving gel on your hand

and apply it on the beard.

Make sure you apply a
thin even layer of it.

A thick layer will prevent the razor

from reaching the hair
making your shave difficult.

Before you start shaving
check the compass strip

on the razor, if it is white
it means your razor blades

are worn out and have to be changed.

If it is blue or green, it
means your razor is okay to use.

Gillette Mach3 has sharper blades

and a pivot head that takes the pressure

of your hand away from the blades

for better skin comfort
and a cleaner shave,

use light gentle strokes
letting the razor do the work.

You are more prone to nicks and cuts

if you apply too much force

or try to move the razor too swiftly.

The Gillette SkinGuard has a flexible head

which adjusts according to your face,

so it is easy to shape even
the trickiest of places.

Rinse your razor frequently to
get rid of the excessive hair

that might be stuck to the blades.

So now the question arises
with or against the grain,

the answer is both, facial
hair grows in any direction,

so shave in the direction
you are comfortable with.

Ideally, shaving both
with and against the grain

should be good to get
rid of the facial hair.

Post-shave, wash your
face with cold water,

this will help close all
the pores on your face

keeping your skin fresh.

The last step in the shaving process

is applying an aftershave lotion,

an aftershave acts as a disinfectant

and helps keep skin moisturized,
making you smell good.

And this is how you go about
your first shaving experience.
