foreign  [Music]  He  Loves Me He Loves Me Not he loves me  he loves me not oh hey hi all you love  birds well Valentine's Day is just  around the corner so we are on the  streets of Delhi to find out if people  believe in love at first sight or do  First Impressions matter so let's go and  find out  so tell me do you believe in love at  first sight or falling for someone after  knowing them for years and why I feel  that knowing a person for years and then  falling in love for him is actually  pretty good because in that case there  is a better compatibility and a better  adjustment  for me it would definitely be calling to  someone after years of knowing them  obviously you can't tell in one day I  believe in love at first sight because I  feel like it's the universe's way of  telling us that they have something with  them oh I totally believe in in the love  at first sight oh why well I think that  love is just an emotion so it just  happened so then we do you believe in  arranged marriages or love marriages  love marriages oh definitely  oh now I believe in arranged marriages  like my father and my mother whomsoever  they will choose for me will be a far  more better person in all terms in the  present I don't believe either in love  marriage or arranged marriage both work  just fine my pick would be love  obviously because there should be choice  because I think in Magic there are  things such as where you don't have a  choice but I think it comes down to  marriage only I I agree with the orange  managers well if you ask me like a year  back I would have said love marriages  but as of the moment I have Supreme  faith in my parents so tell me would you  date someone older or younger than you  well not younger not older who is my age  I think he can understand me better no  not younger actually because I want my  partner to be more mature than me  definitely I don't think so age is an  area for not just for me but for  everyone as well for me wipes match only  I think that the same age is the best  match but well it loves and just happens  so yeah  perfume deal  uh that can enhance the smell of the  butt oh I think that a nice invitation  for food  it's the best plan yeah it's simple it's  emotional is is the best plan I think  commitment is the best gift okay that's  sweet  tell me what according to you is the  best Valentine's Day gift for a girl uh  understanding partner who can respect  someone is the best Valentine in their  gift he can give anything that is  personal to them like that reminds them  of the person that they are and their  respective Partners I think the best  Valentine's Day gift a girl can get is  her man showing her how much he  appreciates her to have a love song  written about you or a romantic book  written about a romantic book hands down  because that's a lot more detail so  kritika tell me one last thing if your  man was a fragrance what would he smell  like okay I'm a fragrance connoisseur so  I would say  um during the Summers he should have the  Sea Breeze and something very clean and  minimalistic during the winters  definitely something on the government  sense creamy and something like that and  during late night something special that  is just something I only know ah you  know when it rains yeah yeah so the  smell of that the mud okay that I just  love that smell so if my man would smell  like that which is I think not possible  a honey Bean oh that's sweet that's kind  uh sweet you know I think he would smell  like Sandalwood a musk and Patchouli  tell me one thing that is lovely and one  thing that is annoying about each other  annoying things she's very lazy at times  and if you love sleeping  the way she takes care of me and my kids  that's you know what I love about her  annoying fist would be he gets quite  irritating at time with his spontaneous  jokes and loving would be his caring  nature he surprises me a lot so he gives  me a lot of surprises annoying snoring  too many of my new things you know she  takes care of them even I don't and  annoying is  uh she's short-term so the one thing  that I find lovely about him is that he  is very caring excessively annoying  about him is that he never picks up my  calls whenever he is with his friends he  never responds to my text that's  something really annoying she respects  me my family and her friends also and  never disappoints me in anything but one  thing that will always be is she get  very irritated in small small things he  is very very much caring okay and  annoying  people is my leg every time one selfless  thing that he does for you that makes  you happy he buys me flaws oh that's  quite cute and what about you every time  it's like uh whenever I want something  or I just never ever mentioned it I just  want this or I like this she just  arrange it from anywhere no I can ask  her to cook me cook anything for me at  any time during the day and she'll do it  for me like if I'm lazing around he  won't disturb me so he'll take care of  the kids see house and everything so  that's right oh that's the best part I  wish someone does the same for me as  well okay so tell me one thing that you  found attractive in him when you guys  first met uh like her smile and uh it's  her cuteness she's so cute like he's  walking from there and I was like please  God please hide me somewhere he's so  cute I feel very simple her Simplicity  was the best thing his looks and his the  way he carries himself he was actually  very funny but now I am the one who gets  up roasted five years ago it was love at  first sight I think he is cute and I  really love his hair I agree yeah he is  cute tell me if you had to gift him  something special for the Valentine's  Day from the man company what product  would it be that grooming kit it's  really nice my friends have used it so  that beard while I'll give grooming kit  it would be a fragrance a perfume so  related to this only if your man was a  fragrance what would he smell like since  we both like donuts it's white chocolate  donut a Musky and Woody yeah uh I would  say vanilla vanilla and that's soft and  sweet yeah yeah  can you smell that well let me tell you  that love is in the air and after this  fun cup shop I'm sure you'll definitely  feel the same so if you want to get  something special for your Valentine
