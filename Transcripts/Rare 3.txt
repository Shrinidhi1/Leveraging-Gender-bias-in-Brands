here we go again

so i've noticed that some days i'm

better than others

but i think i'm slowly starting to get

my system

much i think happens in every case you

kind of have to

work with something to come up with a

routine that

best suits you so i'm going to start

this time

with a little bit of the always an

optimus spray

the reason why is because now

when i put my foundation on

just already pretty breathable

it will move that was one little wand by

the way

very very exciting okay

so the spray just allows it to kind of

move around

[Music]

it's always interesting because my skin

tone isn't

necessarily consistent i could be in the

sun for a few days and

be like medium light to medium and then

if i'm

in the sun for a week or two

i'm pretty tan and then i can be really

pale so

we're talking about having a system with

like this is when i'm pale

this is when i'm light to medium and

this is when i'm tan

another thing i like to do

has put on my lip moisturizer that's

clear

and i'm gonna grab that for a second but

i

i do that and let it soak while i'm

doing my makeup

okay

it goes on like butter

now i'm going to move on to

i get redness all over my nose

that's just kind of like

something i've always struggled with

or just something i have so

[Music]

and here is my farmhouse

of three dogs

[Music]

now i will be using

my blush this one is called grace

it's one of my favorites because it's

not it's not overpowering it seems to be

a really warm

color

[Music]

now i'm going to do

a highlighter

this is a pretty like light dusty pink

one

it's called enchant it's so creepy

back to the dot system

i used two of the brushes so

that one can be blush

lighter whatever and then strictly

foundation

and other stuff so

so today i will be using

a lip color called ascend

it's really really pretty but because

i'm doing such a bright lip i'm going to

keep my eyes very

bare before we do that i'm going to make

sure the brows are good

this is something i've not gotten down

yet

oops

[Music]

ready off we go
