hi I'm the rain barman I'm 24 years old

and I'm from New Delhi and I'm here to

compete for the Peter and mr. India

technique so - is other than modeling I

love that helping people discover their

potential so think of it this way if

you've got a barrier or something that's

holding you back in life I'm the guy who

discovers why you have that area and I

help you push through it

and I feel like contributing to people's

lives in that way it's always brought me

joy and that's what I'm passionate about

mantra and life is people ask me from

every stressed out in a certain

situation and I just passed them would

it help probably not so that's my mantra

in life if you have a stressed out and

people ask if you stressed out just ask

them would it help probably not and so

that's it I mean find out why you're not

succeeding create through that if you're

stressed out over it help and be

everything you love
