welcome to i learned a thing in the

bathroom from

dollar shave club where we explain

something very complicated in mere

minutes

to occupy your brain while you shave in

this edition we'll be discussing

the science of morning wood as explained

by someone who

sounds smart because he's british

morning wood

or to give it its proper name nocturnal

penile

tumescence is something that affects

virtually all men

but the reason why is probably a little

different to what you were expecting

i've always assumed it was related to

the naked supermodel dance party that

happens in my apartment every time i

fall asleep

it's like the tooth fairy only sexier

while that certainly is a theory

it's not the correct answer it's

actually to do with your sleep cycles

related to rapid eye movement sleep it's

triggered by a completely different part

of the brain to the one that gives you

arousal erections rapid what now

rapid eye movement sleep or rem sleep

it's a phase of sleep during which

you're likely to dream vividly

as you enter the stage your brain starts

to shut off various neurotransmitters to

prevent you from acting out your dreams

one of these transmitters norepinephrine

is normally what's in control of your

erections

specifically it causes vasoconstriction

of penis blood cells

actively preventing an erection it is in

simple terms

the reason you don't walk around with a

boner all day uh

in most cases at least it's uh just the

way i'm sitting

anyway i find what you are saying very

interesting uh please continue

right well so norepinephrine decreases

when you went to rem sleep and

testosterone-related activities commence

this leads to vasodilation or increased

blood flow to the blood vessels

ultimately causing an erection one

that's intensified by the fact that the

rem period becomes prolonged as the

morning approaches

the end result is most of the time your

alarm drags you out of your dreams

it's going to be bringing a chubby along

with it so

when does this all start to happen as

weird as it sounds morning wood can

start as early as in utero

that is while you're still in the womb

and it can continue right through life

until you die or at the very least

remain prominent until you're in your

40s

is it you know useful in any way

there are theories that it may be the

body's way of providing adequate oxygen

flow throughout the body

including the genitals it can also serve

as a way to alert you to the fact that

you need to pee

your increased bladder size through the

night stimulates the region of the

spinal cord which can cause a reflex

erection

this in turn wakes you up preventing you

from peeing the bed

this might sound like a stupid question

but

is it just men who get morning wood

that's not such a stupid question

women actually do experience the same

thing in the form of clitoral erections

it's just less visibly obvious when it

happens and far less of a pain in the

butt when they wake up in the night

needing to pee talking of which and on

an entirely unrelated matter that has

absolutely nothing to do with this show

i have to go put my bathroom rug in the

washing machine

tune in next time for more i learned a

thing in the bathroom

and in the meantime head to

dollarshaveclub.com for more podcasts

and a

big old pile of grooming products
