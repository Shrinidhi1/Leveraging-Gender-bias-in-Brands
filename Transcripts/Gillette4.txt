Dad always says, kids learn from what they see.

 

 

For example, take the way of life over here

 

 

The things that boys can do

and what girls are not allowed to do

is clearly visible here

Even when it comes about my fathers profession

It's like the boys get to inherit it

But it's not that girls don't get anything

I have seen it

Even they get their share

Domestic chores, running the kitchen, the responsibility of household

 

 

 

 

Why uncle

Shall I shave your beard?

Dad! How can a girl shave your beard?

 

 

Son! How would a razor know the difference between a boy and a girl?

Why

Let's do it! Give me a shave

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dad is absolutely right

Kids always learn from what they see
