there's so much

pressure everywhere to be a certain way

and i

i feel like the word rare eliminates all

of

the perfectness it's such a beautiful

word especially applying it to people

it's basically saying you're authentic

and you are meant to be who you are and

you're rare

to me

it's a brand that really is all about

accepting who you are and loving who you

are however you love however you look

everyone it's just a safe place where

people can feel comfortable

it's okay not to look like everyone else

you just have to

know who you are and feel confidence in

that

you know doing what floats your boat

it's good to not be like everyone else

just being happy with who you are

it is cool to accept yourself that's my

mission

i am rare i'm rare i'm rare i am red

i am rare

rare beauty
