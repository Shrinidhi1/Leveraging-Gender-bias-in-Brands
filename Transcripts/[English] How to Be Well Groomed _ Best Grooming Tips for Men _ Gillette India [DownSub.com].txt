- Grooming is an essential part of style.

If you want to look good,
you have to be well-groomed.

Here are some quick tips to
maintain a well-groomed look.

Tip one, pay attention to your hair.

A lot of men don't pay
attention to their hair.

Overgrown, unkempt hair
can give you a very messy,

shabby appearance.

So get a haircut, often.

Wash, manage and style your
hair so it looks perfect

but don't overload it
with styling products.

Tip two, use a face wash.

The skin on your face is more
sensitive than your body.

That's why soap is not the solution.

A good face wash helps you
cleanse your pores, get rid

of oils and dead skin cells
and exfoliates your skin.

Tip three, shave that beard.

A clean shaving look makes
you look fresher and younger

so make sure you shave regularly.

Invest in a good razor.

The Gillette MACH3, but
stronger than steel blades

and an adjustable head
gives you a smooth shave

and leaves you looking
well-groomed in minutes.

Tip four, smell good always.

Body odor can be a deal breaker.

Make sure you use a good
deodorant or perfume

which lasts long, leaving
your smelling good

even after a long day.

Tip five, apply sunscreen.

Before stepping out, apply
sunscreen on your face and hands.

It'll protect your skin against UV days

and prevent skin tanning.
