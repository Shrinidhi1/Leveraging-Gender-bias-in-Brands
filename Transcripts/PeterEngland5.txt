hi everyone whether it's a day long

business trip or month-long vacation the

last thing we usually do is pack our

bags so here I am with a few tips on how

to pack your bag

I really hate checking in my luggage so

all I do is stuff everything here into

this duffel bag a quick in-and-out of

the airport is the best way to travel

this is the duffle bag from Peter

England

I really like the variety of pouches on

the lab they don't just look good

they're very practical as well

sturdy buckles - it's a new bag I picked

up nice and compact with plenty of room

for all of this don't think it's

possible
