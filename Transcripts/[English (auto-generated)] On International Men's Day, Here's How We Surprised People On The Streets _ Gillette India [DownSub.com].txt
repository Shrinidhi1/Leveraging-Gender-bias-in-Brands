thank you

thank you okay bye

my god it feels like I thank my father

almost after a decade

that we don't thank our fathers our

brothers basically all the special men

in our lives enough attitude

and then we also tend to think that men

are less emotional and invulnerable

but you know what I actually think that

men are equally emotional and they too

deserve to be told that they are loved

and appreciated women

do you know that there's also an

international men's day to celebrate all

the special men in your life

[Music]

hi hi what's your name I'm Nadi my name

is Neha my name is

how are you celebrating this Saturday

weekend day it calls for celebrations do

you know that there's something special

on Saturday this Saturday yeah no you

don't know what international men's day

oh I mean I know about International

men's day but I didn't know it was on

this Saturday actually I am hearing

about this for the first time really

Wednesday yes you heard about it yeah I

heard about it but it is not very

celebrated that's correct I do know what

international women's yes I'm sure men

have their day too so no special party

being planned for the special man in

your life you guys don't do anything

special on that day no not actually not

really I'm not good at remembering dates

so definitely I don't remember the dates

but yeah if I remember it I make sure

that I some do something special for the

person well for the men in the house yes

yes I I do have my father and my brother

do you feel that sometimes you know we

don't thank the special men in our lives

enough definitely and that's exactly why

you should be doing it on every single

day basis it's very tough telling

fathers and the men that how much we

love them because they don't want to

show themselves emotionally weak so if

we tell them we love them they're like

okay huh I mean now that you say you

know in real life you don't really thank

them that happens you miss thanking them

so which is that one special man in your

life

brother and my father my husband his

name is Ashu brother

think as a woman you grow up with that

with that figure where you're always

admiring the man in your life and that's

your father and what is the one thing

that inspires most about him he has just

amazing Clarity of thought patience

and composers he's very gentle it's not

a quality is associated with men usually

hard situation

give your brother thank you note to him
