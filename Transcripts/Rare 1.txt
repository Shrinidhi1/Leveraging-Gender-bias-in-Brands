hey guys it's selena gomez i am super

excited to show you how i got this look

today

and we get to use my new stay vulnerable

collection i started with washing my

face

and using moisturizer so basically

all i have on right now are some lashes

i'm individuals

and i'm getting ready to do my face

so i'm gonna start with my primer which

everyone knows is one of my favorite

things especially for a glowy look

i'm gonna use my hands with this

you can already tell too when i'm

applying it how it already just melts

into your skin

next i'm going to use the liquid touch

foundation

my color right now is 180. i kind of go

through this

dot application that i do there's so

much formula in it that

it's pretty pretty easy to spread around

and use my brush

obviously you can do a heavier

foundation look if you'd like

every time i use the foundation it just

starts to feel more and more like my

skin

and i feel like when i put it on lightly

i

don't feel like it's too far off from my

skin

because it kind of looks like i'm not

wearing any makeup right now

next is the liquid touch brightening

concealer

and with this applicator it's really

really easy

to kind of get into the corner of your

eye

i definitely love concealer sometimes i

can just use concealer depending on how

my skin is

again i like to do everything pretty

delicate so when i put my concealer on i

definitely do the motion that's very

soft and

in circular motion after i apply my

makeup

i always do another layer of concealer

and a pimple whatever now you can see

that it's super glowy

my skin looks really fresh um you kind

of can't tell that there's really any

makeup

and it feels really good that means i'm

now going to move on

to the always optimus 4 in one setting

mist

it's always my favorite give it a little

shake

about eight inches away

next i'm going to use the positive light

luminizer and that will be

an enchant i love all my luminizers it

goes well with different skin tones as

well

this one happens to be one of my

favorites i can use

some of the highlighter for the tip of

my nose and right above my lip but i

don't like

kind of focus on that area i keep more

of the luminizer

up into the higher cheekbones this is my

blot and glow

touch-up kit so this palette also comes

with some excess oil

papers if you need to tap i don't think

i'm going to do that right now i'm going

for more of a glowy

look i'm going to apply the powder

[Music]

under my eyes and then the sponge

put

so as you can tell i just kind of went

into my t-zone

kind of put the powder there a little

around my nose

now i'm going to use my liquid eyeshadow

and the color is nearly neutral they're

very tiny

and really really cute on the go so the

applicator

again similar to the concealer has this

sort of

edge feeling um and i'm gonna go in

more towards the bottom

of my lashes because then from there

i can move the product around it

definitely is high pigmented as you can

see

just barely without doing anything you

can see the color

around my eye and it's such a beautiful

color very natural

um especially when i move it around and

along with that i'm going to be using

the stay vulnerable all over

eyeshadow brush it kind of looks like a

finger you know

has a little bit of the slant i'm going

to go in with the shadow

and move it around

the shadow definitely wears all day it's

very as you can tell it has

got a lot of pigment and we've created

the eye shadow um so that it wouldn't

have the crease effect that most

shadows do this is our number one

selling product and it is the perfect

strokes matte liquid

eyeliner i was very very happy and

honored and excited when we got the news

so naturally i'm going to be applying it

give it a few

shakes make sure you have all of that

pigment and the color that you want and

start right here

and then i connect it all

again you go into that lash area make

sure that it's all covered

now i'm going to do the next eye now i

have my eyeliner on

we are moving on to my brows this is the

brow harmony pencil and gel

this one's in cool brown which is the

color i use it's kind of

i feel like for me if i want to do dark

i'll go dark but if i'm going natural

i'll use the cool brown

how i use it kind of get the

gel a little bit off i like to start

with brushing

my brows

i remove tons of the product because

then i use it at the end

and then i can use it so after i've done

that

i'll go in and kind of dust around the

area of my brow

i want to make sure i get it all in so i

usually start on

the outside so there's one eyebrow

super easy i'm gonna do the next one now

so here is one of the newer products um

it is called the stay vulnerable

melting blush and it is in nearly

neutral i call it a little pebble

because it's so cute and you can fit

anywhere

but what i'm using is the nearly neutral

color

i like to use my hands for this one but

people you can use the brush

you can use my brush that you like or

whatever one

i'm going to go tap it in

i'm gonna do a little bit on the apple

i would describe it as kind of a mousse

i feel like this is different from our

liquid blushes

in the sense of it's not as

prominent and it's kind of more of that

feeling that you want to use your hands

with i use

the liquid one when i feel very bright

and i want

more color but since we're doing a

natural look today

this is kind of the color i want

it looks a little like sun kissed the

finish is a natural matte

um and i think i i love that because

everything else on my skin is very glowy

so even when i kind of had some around

the luminizer it doesn't take away that

glow

which i love next we are going to the

stay

vulnerable glossy lip balm again in

nearly neutral

now these are newer and these are so fun

and

i just think that every girl wants a

good pop of lip gloss every now and then

i've been super into lip glosses right

now this color is also

really beautiful it goes well with my

skin tone can go well with

any skin tone really but i love how

brown and neutrals look on me

the applicator is also really amazing

because we kind of have this

hole in the middle that is what i call

it and it holds more

of the gloss so that when you're using

it

a lot more comes out as you're applying

the very tip is easy for me to go

and do a kind of liner effect that's

just with two dips already

the lip gloss doesn't feel like a

traditional lip gloss

sometimes it can be really sticky and we

stayed away from that so the color and

the texture

is very smooth and it kind of is easy to

apply

anywhere anytime without a mirror unless

you're driving don't do anything while

you're driving so i feel like this kind

of completes a look for me

the lips feel really great i still kind

of have this area

where my pimple is to be honest i'm not

going to cover it up

i think that the look i have right now

is nice and

it'll last me all day i'm really happy

with how everything turned out

and i'm excited for everyone to try it

as well

this look has been one of my favorites

and

i'm excited that you can use it and

share it

and show me all the looks that you do

which have been amazing by the way
