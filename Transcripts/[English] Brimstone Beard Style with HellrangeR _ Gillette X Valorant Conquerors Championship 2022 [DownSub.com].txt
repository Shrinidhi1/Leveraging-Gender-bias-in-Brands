So Brimstone this is going to be easy because I 
have roughly the same style of beard.

First, let me trim to get an even length of
 hair throughout my beard.

For any style of beard to look good you need to clean up your neck and upper cheek

 even for the thickest and longest beards.

If you follow me or Ocean, you must be assuming we usually get ourselves styled by good stylists

Before every game we groom ourselves nicely

But really this is my pro stylist to get clear 
sharp beard lines you need a safe single blade  

A barber's Ustra or even a safety razor in which 
you screw in a blade needs a lot of practice but  

this back blade is perfectly safe while giving 
you well defined beard edges.

This is a precision that a true esports player puts 
into his style the game I am going to turn my chin up

 and do the same with the beard lines under my chin so that 
my neckline also looks that clean and it's done
