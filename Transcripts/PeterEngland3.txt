so where do you see yourself five years

from now I see myself mmm learning to

play a new instrument I think I want to

go green and yellow and blue maybe pink

you know what I want to wake up early in

the morning and you want to be everyday

[Music]

at least try you know and I want to make

something beautiful with my own hands

[Music]

I want to read the goal in Bengali I

want to be an extreme skateboarder

probably a bad idea but I do see myself

learning to fly

I want to see a wild and be wild you

know the usual and them what about you

guys

the other thing you love teetering

[Music]
