I mean, I don't know exactly why I got
the cross, but the message is all about love, you know?

I try to acknowledge everyone I see, you know?

I don't want people to not feel seen

Now that I'm where I'm at in my life, I'm completely myself

And I know that my
homies don't judge me for who I am and the person I am is exactly the way I'm supposed to be
