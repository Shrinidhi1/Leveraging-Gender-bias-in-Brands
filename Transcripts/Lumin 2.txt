rub this on your dry skin and you start

to see the dead skin cells fall off

dude what are you doing we don't use bar

soap to wash our face

[Music]

this is the anti-fatigue set this stuff

was on GQ Forbes Benz Health let's see

if it's worth the hype and was free

right nothing to lose time for the

charcoal cleanser skin already feels a

little bit cleaner

wow these suns are fun

looking good man I like that this

chocolate plants are ready to go so it

can't get right out of your pores now

for the exfoliating rub now apparently

you just rub this into your dry skin and

you'll start to see the dead skin fall

off no or breakouts I feel some of that

that texture is not dead skin coming on

I can't believe how much dead skin is

falling off my face and now the

moisturizing balm

the stuff we have to use in the morning

and night well this step is so easy

makes more face look alive find a friend

that'll do this for you let's complete

this the dark circle defense you just

down to put on your eyes wake up and

boom
