that's the toughest man I know Air Force

veteran Biswanath Sinha my dad I

remember as a child I was chased by an

angry bull and I ran straight towards

him crying he held me in his arms and

said wipe those tears off you are a man

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

I guess I stopped crying because I

wanted to be like him tough and strong

so no matter how hard you've taken a hit

no tears

and so I had I had my pain like dad

would want me to I did not want him to

see my wounds the time week I was being

a man but this time he didn't ask me to

wipe my tears off

[Music]

that moment changes daughter

[Applause]

that's the day we both realized that

showing what you really feel

it doesn't make you less of a man

raising a strong boy also meant telling

him it was okay it was okay for boys to

cry men can cry even soldiers can cry

[Music]

because our big TVs the best in us

[Music]

[Music]
