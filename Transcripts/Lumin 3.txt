I don't really have a skincare routine

but my girl wants me to take better care

of it

so she got me Moomin it's a 90-second

skin care routine and it's delivered to

your door let's try it out so this is

the charcoal cleanser this is good for

excess oil dead skin clogged pores very

refreshing smell I should have been

doing this a long time ago what's next

this is the exfoliating rub so this

stuff is good for acne scars and shaving

irritation I did not know my skin needed

something like this my face already

feels so much better

last but not least the moisturizing balm

it's really good for hydration

immediately just feel so much better so

good how much was this it was free I

just had to pay for shipping what
