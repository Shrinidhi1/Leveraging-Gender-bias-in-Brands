- [Messay] Building men for others is

what we talk about every day.

The young men that we coach
that come to Saint Frances

They've had adversity
or things in their lives

that your average athlete,

student athlete or just
your average teenager,

doesn't come across.

You talk about being
hungry for an education

or being excited to be educated.

But some of these guys have to worry

about if they can eat day to day,

depending where they're coming from.

- Saint Frances been helping
under privileged kids

and kids of color and for years,

even before the football thing.

- It would be impossible for me to deny

that maybe 90 percent of the
people who are affiliated

with Saint Frances heard
about us because of football.

It is indeed the front porch,

but when they discover

what we did long before football got here,

they really embrace it and
fall in love with the place.

- 1828 is when the school was
founded by a woman of color,

Mother Mary Lange,

and the school was founded
out of social disobedience,

in that it was illegal to teach

the children of slaves how to read.

And back in those days,

African Americans in this
city couldn't own property,

unless it was by a cemetery or prison.

So we're right across from the prison.

- I seen that jail for what does,

I could have been on that other
side of watching the school.

I don't wanna live that life.

So I decided to learn from not really,

just by looking at it.

(upbeat music)

- You got schools that don't wanna play us

because they think we're too good,

and it just puts further
constraints on the program

us playing and so forth.

So, despite that,

these kids have really done well,

the amount of scholarships
this program gives,

all through the support of Biff Poggi

and the other coaches who's helped.

- I don't know where I'll
be without Saint Frances.

- Made me a better person.

Made me a better man in life.

- It's a small little school next to jail,

does the unthinkable.
