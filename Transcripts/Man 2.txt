No one has ever written poetry on your eyes,

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses.

You wander floor by floor,

cleaning the world,

As if hanging from the sky.

But when you see a mirror, and take a pause,

Man, you slay!

You, who don't let fights get ugly,

when you steal a glance to look at your clothes,

you really look cute.

In the traffic's rage

you sound like an Indian classical flute

And when you bring flowers for yourself too,

Man, you slay!

You take time out of ledgers

and make time to read a book.

Those years of struggle we spent together,

I never remember that as a bad phase

You share everything except your recipe

You dare so much, and so casually

When you almost get smitten by yourself and smile,

Man, you slay!

But when you keep your negative vibes in trash.

And instead of taking care of your ego, you take care of yourself.

You look mind-blowing.

Yet. no one has ever written poetry on your eyes,

I don't think a song was ever composed about your tresses

I feel I can cross any river when I am with you,

The one who is called a Gentleman in English,

My friend, that someone is you.
