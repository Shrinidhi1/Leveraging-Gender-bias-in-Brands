as a woman i am proud of myself proud of

myself what makes me happy is

a lot of things make me happy but i

would say my job makes me really happy

my next steps are

unknown whatever brings me joy makes me

happy my advice for the next generation

of young women is to never

forget the power that you hold within

yourself the message i'd like to share

for women's day is embrace all the parts

of yourself that make you who you are i

feel the main issues facing women i mean

there's a lot of issues

lack of opportunity i feel the

opportunities that women could step into

or anything literally anything you want

to do i honor the women in my life by

loving them for exactly who they are and

remembering to tell them that i love

them i think education equity is

important because everyone deserves the

opportunity to learn
