i've always loved lipstick since the day

i saw my mom applying red lipstick red

lipstick was my favorite from the very

beginning that's hot right lipstick in

general completely transforms the look

even if you don't have on a stitch of

makeup if you have on a good strong

lipstick it changes everything so cute

now this is mvp can't forget it this red

works for every skin tone

this shade is called scala sista it's

just a really good nude i love nudes

with a little mauvy hint

this lipstick took two years to

completely create i wanted something

that not just performed well but also

was giving you nutrients as you were

wearing it all day it feels really

comfortable on the lips thanks to our

hyaluronic acid and our extra vitamins

that we have in the formula it's full

coverage with a creamy yet semi-matte

finish fun fact we actually tailored the

top of this lipstick bullet to match the

shape of my lip right here it makes it

super easy to create whatever shape and

application you need

this case is no joke it's really really

beautiful from the outside to refill the

icon lipsticks you just pick your

lipstick shade any shade pop the bullet

into the base and then click it into the

case pretty genius actually
